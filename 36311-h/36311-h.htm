<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The first serious discussion of <i>The Mystery of Edwin
Drood</i> came from the pen of the astronomer, Mr. R. A.
Proctor.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor wrote various essays on the
subject.&nbsp; One appears in his <i>Leisure Readings</i>,
included in Messrs. Longmans&rsquo; &lsquo;Silver
Library.&rsquo;&nbsp; A second was published in 1887, and
entitled <i>Watched by the Dead</i>.&nbsp; There were, I believe,
in addition some periodical articles by Mr. Proctor; these I have
not seen.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor modified certain positions in his
earlier essay included in <i>Leisure Readings</i>, so that the
paper must not be taken as representative of his final
views.&nbsp; Whatever may be thought of Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s
theory, all will admit that he devoted much care and ingenuity to
the study, and that he had an exceptional knowledge of
Dickens&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>In 1905 Mr. Cuming Walters published his <i>Clues to
Dickens&rsquo;s Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>.&nbsp; The
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> expressed its conviction &lsquo;that in
these hundred pages or so he has found the <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>clue, the main
secret which had baffled all previous investigators, and so has
secured permanent association with one of the
immortals.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Cuming Walters&rsquo;s book was
immediately followed by Mr. Andrew Lang&rsquo;s <i>The Puzzle of
Dickens&rsquo;s Last Plot</i>.&nbsp; In this Mr. Lang adopted
with modifications the theory of Mr. Proctor.&nbsp; The subject
continued to interest this lamented author to the end of his
life.&nbsp; He wrote many letters and articles on the theme,
coming ultimately to the conclusion that Dickens did not know
himself how his story was to be ended.</p>
<p>In 1910 Professor Henry Jackson of Cambridge published a
volume, <i>About Edwin Drood</i>.&nbsp; It is a work of sterling
merit, and particularly valuable for its study of the chronology
of the story.&nbsp; Dr. Jackson was the first to examine the
manuscript in a scholarly way, and to give some of the chief
results.&nbsp; His conclusions are in the main those of Mr.
Cuming Walters, but they are supported by fresh arguments and
criticisms.</p>
<p>There have been many articles on the subject, particularly in
that excellent periodical, the <i>Dickensian</i>, edited by Mr.
B. W. Matz.&nbsp; Of this magazine it may be said that every
number <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>adds something to our knowledge of the great author.</p>
<p>By far the most successful attempt to finish the book is that
of Gillan Vase, which was published in 1878.&nbsp; It is the only
continuation worth looking at.</p>
<p>Among the best of the periodical contributions are those by
Dr. M. R. James of Cambridge, published in the <i>Academy</i>,
and in the <i>Cambridge Review</i>.&nbsp; The papers of Mr. G. F.
Gadd in the <i>Dickensian</i> deserve special praise.&nbsp; In
the <i>Bookman</i> Mr. B. W. Matz, whose knowledge of Dickens is
unsurpassed, has declared for the view that Edwin Drood was
murdered, but has not committed himself to any theory of
Datchery.</p>
<p>I should not have been justified in publishing this volume if
I had been able to add no new material.&nbsp; But I venture to
think it will be found that while I have freely used the
arguments and the discoveries of previous investigators, I have
made a considerable addition to the stores.&nbsp; In particular,
I have brought out the fact that Forster declined to accept
Dickens&rsquo;s erasures in the later proofs, and I have printed
the passages which Dickens meant to have omitted.&nbsp; The
effect of the omissions is also traced to a certain extent,
though not fully.&nbsp; <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>The more one studies them, the more
significant they appear.</p>
<p>I have printed completely for the first time the Notes and
Plans for the novel.&nbsp; I have also published some notes on
the manuscript based on a careful examination.&nbsp; These notes
are not by any means complete, but they include perhaps the more
important facts.&nbsp; Through the kindness of Miss Bessie Hatton
and Mr. B. W. Matz I have been able to give an account of the
unacted play by Charles Dickens the younger and Joseph Hatton on
<i>Edwin Drood</i>.</p>
<p>I have also put together for the first time the external
evidence on the subject.&nbsp; It is particularly important that
this evidence should be read in full, and much of it is now
inaccessible to the general reader.&nbsp; In the discussion of
the main problems it will, I believe, be found that certain new
arguments have been brought forward.&nbsp; In particular I ask
attention to the quotations from the Bancroft <i>Memoirs</i> and
from <i>No Name</i>.&nbsp; I have also given certain studies of
the methods of Dickens which may be useful.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge with warm thanks the kindness of Mr.
Hugh Thomson in sending me his reading of the Wrapper.</p>
<p><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>It
will thus, I hope, be found that the study is a contribution to
the subject, and not a mere repetition or paraphrase of what has
been advanced.</p>
<p>I have made no attempt at summarising the novel.&nbsp; No one
can possibly attack the problem with any hope of success who has
not read the book over and over again.&nbsp; A hasty perusal will
serve no purpose.&nbsp; The fragment deserves and repays the very
closest study.</p>
<p>There are questions that have been raised and arguments that
have been stated which are not mentioned here.&nbsp; This is not
because of ignorance.&nbsp; I have read, I believe, practically
all that has been published on the theme.&nbsp; What I have
omitted is matter that seems to me trivial or irrelevant.</p>
<p>While fully believing in the accuracy of the conclusions I
have reached, I desire to avoid dogmatism.&nbsp; There is always
the possibility that a writer may be diverted from his
purpose.&nbsp; He may come to difficulties he cannot
surmount.&nbsp; The fact that scholarly students of Dickens have
come to different conclusions is a fact to be taken into
account.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to Lord Rosebery for kindly accepting the
dedication of the volume.&nbsp; <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>Lord Rosebery is, however, in no way
responsible for my arguments or my conclusions.</p>
<p>In preparing this study I have had the constant assistance and
counsel of my accomplished colleague, Miss Jane T.
Stoddart.&nbsp; Miss Stoddart&rsquo;s accuracy and learning and
acuteness have been of the greatest use to me, and there is
scarcely a chapter in the volume which does not owe much to
her.</p>
<p>Mr. J. H. Ingram has most kindly furnished me with information
about Poe.</p>
<p>Mr. Clement Shorter has allowed me to use his very valuable
collection of newspaper articles.</p>
<p>Mr. B. W. Matz has very courteously answered some inquiries,
and he has permitted me to use his valuable bibliography.</p>
<p>Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall have kindly given me permission to
use the Wrapper, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters has been so kind as to read the proofs.</p>
<p>If there are those who think that the problem does not deserve
consideration, I am not careful to answer them.&nbsp; It is a
problem which will be discussed as long as Dickens is read.&nbsp;
Those who believe that Dickens is the greatest humorist and one
of the greatest novelists in English <a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>literature, are proud to make any
contribution, however insignificant, to the understanding of his
works.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, in his &lsquo;Essay on the Place of
Homer in Education,&rsquo; mentions the tradition of Dorotheus,
who spent the whole of his life in endeavouring to elucidate the
meaning of a single word in Homer.&nbsp; Without fully justifying
this use of time, we may agree in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s general
conclusion &lsquo;that no exertion spent upon any of the classics
of the world, and attended with any amount of real result, is
thrown away.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The three mysteries of <i>Edwin Drood</i> are thus stated by
Mr. Cuming Walters:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first mystery, partly solved by Dickens himself, is
the fate of Edwin Drood.&nbsp; Was he murdered?&mdash;if so, how
and by whom, and where was his body hidden?&nbsp; If not, how did
he escape, and what became of him, and did he reappear?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The second mystery is&mdash;Who was Mr. Datchery, the
&ldquo;stranger who appeared in Cloisterham&rdquo; after
Drood&rsquo;s disappearance?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The third mystery is&mdash;Who was the old opium woman,
called the Princess Puffer, and why did she pursue John
Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is with the first two of these mysteries that this book is
concerned.&nbsp; In the concluding chapter some hints are offered
as to the third, but in my opinion there are no sufficient
materials for any definite answer.</p>
<p>The problem before us is to decide with one <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>half of
Dickens&rsquo;s book in our possession what the course of the
other half was likely to be.</p>
<p>It is important to lay stress upon this.&nbsp; An able
reviewer in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 1st April 1911, says:
&lsquo;The book is still in its infancy.&nbsp; Its predecessor,
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, attained to some sixty-seven chapters,
<i>Great Expectations</i> to fifty-nine, <i>Bleak House</i> to
sixty-six.&nbsp; There is no strain on probability in supposing
that <i>Edwin Drood</i> might, in happier circumstances, have
reached something like these proportions.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact
is that the book was to be completed in twelve numbers, and we
have six.</p>
<p>In the first part of this volume I have dealt with the
materials for a solution.</p>
<p>In the second part, I have used the materials and the internal
evidence of the book, and attempted an answer to the
questions.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>PART
I.&mdash;THE MATERIALS FOR A SOLUTION</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I&mdash;THE TEXT OF EDWIN DROOD</h3>
<p>The materials for the solution of the &lsquo;Edwin
Drood&rsquo; problems must first of all be found in the text of
the unfinished volume.&nbsp; Hitherto it has not been observed
that the book we have is not precisely what it was when Dickens
left it.&nbsp; Three parts had been issued by Dickens
himself.&nbsp; After his death the remaining three parts were
issued by John Forster.&nbsp; Dickens had corrected his proofs up
to and including chapter xxi.&nbsp; The succeeding chapters xxii.
and xxiii. are untouched.&nbsp; I discovered to my great surprise
on examining the proofs in the Forster Collection that Forster
had in every case ignored Dickens&rsquo;s erasures, and had
replaced all the omitted passages in the text.&nbsp; Thus it
happens that we do not read the book as Dickens intended us to
read it.&nbsp; We have passages which on consideration he decided
not to print.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to criticise <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the action of
Forster, but it seems clear that he should at least have given
warning to the reader.&nbsp; I now print the passages erased by
Dickens and restored by Forster.</p>

<h4>SENTENCES AND PARTS OF SENTENCES ERASED BY DICKENS</h4>
<p>In Chapter <span class="smcap">xvii</span>.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>an eminent public character</i>, <i>once known
to fame as Frosty faced Fogo</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><i>by</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>as it seemed</i>,
<i>on errands of antagonistically snatching something from
somebody</i>, <i>and never giving anything to anybody</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Sir</i>,&rsquo; <i>said Mr.
Honeythunder</i>, <i>in his tremendous voice</i>, <i>like a
schoolmaster issuing orders to a boy of whom he had a bad
opinion</i>, &lsquo;<i>sit down</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crisparkle seated himself</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Honeythunder having signed the remaining few score of a
few thousand circulars</i>, <i>calling upon a corresponding
number of families without means to come forward</i>, <i>stump up
instantly</i>, <i>and be Philanthropists</i>, <i>or go to the
Devil</i>, <i>another shabby stipendiary Philanthropist</i>
(<i>highly disinterested</i>, <i>if in earnest</i>) <i>gathered
these into a basket and walked off with them</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span><i>when they were alone</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><i>Mr. Crisparkle rose</i>; <i>a little heated in
the face</i>, <i>but with perfect command of himself</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Mr. Honeythunder</i>,&rsquo; <i>he said</i>,
<i>taking up the papers referred to</i>: &lsquo;<i>my being
better or worse employed than I am at present is a matter of
taste and opinion</i>.&nbsp; <i>You might think me better
employed in enrolling myself a member of your
Society</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Ay</i>, <i>indeed</i>, <i>sir</i>!&rsquo;
<i>retorted Mr. Honeythunder</i>, <i>shaking his head in a
threatening manner</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>It would have been better
for you if you had done that long ago</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I think otherwise</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Or</i>,&rsquo; <i>said Mr. Honeythunder</i>,
<i>shaking his head again</i>, &lsquo;<i>I might think one of
your profession better employed in devoting himself to the
discovery and punishment of guilt than in leaving that duty to be
undertaken by a layman</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Perhaps I expect to retain it
still</i>?&rsquo; <i>Mr. Crisparkle returned</i>,
<i>enlightened</i>; &lsquo;<i>do you mean that
too</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Well</i>, <i>sir</i>,&rsquo; <i>returned the
professional Philanthropist</i>, <i>getting up and thrusting his
hands down into his trousers pockets</i>, &lsquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t
go about measuring people for caps</i>.&nbsp; <i>If people find I
have </i><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span><i>any about me that fit &rsquo;em</i>, <i>they can put
&rsquo;em on and wear &rsquo;em</i>, <i>if they like</i>.&nbsp;
<i>That&rsquo;s their look out</i>: <i>not mine</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><i>It seems a little hard to be so tied to a
stake</i>, <i>and innocent</i>; <i>but I don&rsquo;t
complain</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>And you must expect no miracle to help you</i>,
<i>Neville</i>,&rsquo; <i>said Mr. Crisparkle</i>,
<i>compassionately</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>No</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>I know that</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><i>and that of course I am guiding myself by the
advice of such a friend and helper</i>.&nbsp; <i>Such a good
friend and helper</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>He took the fortifying hand from his shoulder</i>, <i>and
kissed it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Crisparkle beamed at the books</i>,
<i>but not so brightly as when he had entered</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><i>But they were as serviceable as they were
precious to Neville Landless</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t think so</i>,&rsquo;
<i>said the Minor Canon</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>There is duty to be
done here</i>; <i>and there are womanly feeling</i>,
<i>sense</i>, <i>and courage wanted here</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I meant</i>,&rsquo; <i>explained Neville</i>,
&lsquo;<i>that the surroundings are so dull and unwomanly</i>,
<i>and that Helena can have no suitable friend or society
here</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You have only to remember</i>,&rsquo; <i>said Mr.
</i><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span><i>Crisparkle</i>, &lsquo;<i>that you are here
yourself</i>, <i>and that she has to draw you into the
sunlight</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>They were silent for a little while</i>, <i>and then Mr.
Crisparkle began anew</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>When we first spoke together</i>, <i>Neville</i>,
<i>you told me that your sister had risen out of the
disadvantages of your past lives as superior to you as the tower
of Cloisterham Cathedral is higher than the chimneys of Minor

<h4>THE MANUSCRIPT</h4>
<p>I make also a few notes based on a careful examination of the
manuscript.&nbsp; Certain passages are rewritten, and the result
pasted over the original page.&nbsp; These passages have been
noted.&nbsp; Also certain sentences have been altered in form,
sometimes by the substitution of one word for another, and
sometimes by the addition of words.&nbsp; It is not necessary to
give every example, but a few may be noted.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the second chapter the passage beginning
&lsquo;I have been taking opium for a pain,&rsquo; including the
long paragraph which follows, has been entirely rewritten and
pasted on.</p>
<p>In the description of the Landlesses in chapter vi. Dickens
made certain changes.&nbsp; As the sentence stands now it reads
as follows:&nbsp; &lsquo;An <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>unusually handsome lithe young
fellow, and an unusually handsome lithe girl; much alike; both
very dark, and very rich in colour; she of almost the gipsy type;
something untamed about them both; a certain air upon them of
hunter and huntress; yet withal a certain air of being the
objects of the chase, rather than the followers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As originally written it read thus: &lsquo;A handsome young
fellow, and a handsome girl; both dark and rich in colour; she
quite gipsy like; something untamed about them both; a certain
air upon them of hunter and huntress; yet a certain air of being
the objects of the chase, rather than the followers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In chapter vii., where Neville is speaking of his sister, as
we have the passage it reads: &lsquo;In a last word of reference
to my sister, sir (we are twin children), you ought to know, to
her honour, that nothing in our misery ever subdued her, though
it often cowed me.&nbsp; When we ran away from it (we ran away
four times in six years, to be soon brought back and cruelly
punished), the flight was always of her planning and
leading.&nbsp; Each time she dressed as a boy, and showed the
daring of a man.&nbsp; I take it we were seven years old when we
first <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>decamped; but I remember, when I lost the pocket-knife
with which she was to have cut her hair short, how desperately
she tried to tear it out, or bite it off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The original version ran thus: &lsquo;In reference to my
sister, sir (we are twin children), you ought to know, to her
honour, that nothing in our misery ever cowed her, though it
often cowed me.&nbsp; When we ran away from it (we ran away four
times in five years, to be very soon brought back and punished),
the flight was always of her planning.&nbsp; Each time she
dressed as a boy, and showed the daring of a man.&nbsp; I take it
we were eight years old when we first decamped; but I remember,
when I lost the pocket-knife with which she was to have cut her
hair short, that she tried to tear it out, or bite it
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the beginning of chapter xviii. we read of the stranger in
Cloisterham: &lsquo;Being buttoned up in a tightish blue
surtout.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was originally: &lsquo;Being dressed
in a tightish blue surtout.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little further on in
the same paragraph we have: &lsquo;He stood with his back to the
empty fireplace.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dickens originally wrote: &lsquo;He
stood with his back to the fireplace.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the next
paragraph &lsquo;His shock of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>white hair&rsquo; was originally
&lsquo;His shock of long white hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same chapter, when Datchery and the boy are standing
looking at Jasper&rsquo;s rooms we have the following sentence:
&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, with a second
look of some interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was originally written:
&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, with an
appearance of interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the final proofs this
passage was entirely struck out.&nbsp; On the next page we have
this sentence: &lsquo;Mr. Datchery, taking off his hat to give
that shock of white hair of his another shake, seemed quite
resigned, and betook himself whither he had been
directed.&rsquo;&nbsp; The original version ran thus: &lsquo;Mr.
Datchery, taking off his hat and giving his shock of white hair
another shake, was quite resigned, and betook himself whither he
had been directed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little further on in the same chapter, when Datchery first
goes into Jasper&rsquo;s room we have: &lsquo;&ldquo;I beg
pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, making a leg with his hat under
his arm.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was originally written, &ldquo;I beg
pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, hat in hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the last paragraph of this chapter we have: &lsquo;Said Mr.
Datchery to himself that night, as he looked at his white hair in
the gas-lighted <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>looking-glass over the coffee-room chimney-piece at the
Crozier, and shook it out: &ldquo;For a single buffer, of an easy
temper, living idly on his means, I have had a rather busy
afternoon!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; This was originally written:
&lsquo;Said Mr. Datchery to himself that night as he looked at
his white hair in the gas-lighted looking-glass over the
coffee-room chimney-piece at the Crozier: &ldquo;Well, for a
single buffer of an easy temper, living idly on his means, I have
had rather a busy afternoon!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>In chapter xx., when Grewgious is talking about Bazzard we
have the following: &lsquo;&ldquo;No, he goes his way, after
office hours.&nbsp; In fact, he is off duty here, altogether,
just at present; and a firm downstairs, with which I have
business relations, lend me a substitute.&nbsp; But it would be
extremely difficult to replace Mr. Bazzard.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Originally Dickens wrote: &lsquo;&ldquo;No, he goes his ways
after office hours.&nbsp; In fact, he is off duty at present; and
a firm downstairs with which I have business relations, lend me a
substitute.&nbsp; But it would be difficult to replace Mr.
Bazzard.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chapter xxii. is much corrected, and the whole of the second
paragraph is rewritten and pasted on.&nbsp; Chapter xxiii. is
also a good deal <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>corrected.&nbsp; Near the beginning we have the
following: &lsquo;The Cathedral doors have closed for the night;
and the Choir-master, on a short leave of absence for two or
three services, sets his face towards London.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
was originally written: &lsquo;The Cathedral doors have closed
for the night; and the Choir-master, on leave of absence for a
few days, sets his face towards London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The passage beginning: &lsquo;But she goes no further away
from it than the chair upon the hearth,&rsquo; and the next two
paragraphs are entirely rewritten and pasted on, and the
following sentences are cancelled: &lsquo;&ldquo;So far I might
a&rsquo;most as well have never found out how to set you
talking,&rdquo; is her commentary.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too
sleepy to talk too plain.&nbsp; You hold your secrets right you
do!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; A little further on we have:
&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; he cries in a low voice, seeing her
brought to a standstill: &ldquo;who are you looking
for?&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; This was originally
&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; cries this gentleman, &ldquo;who are
you looking for?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the next page we have: &lsquo;With his uncovered gray hair
blowing about.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dickens originally wrote: &lsquo;With
his gray hair blowing about.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>On the
same page, when Datchery and the opium woman are talking together
Dickens puts in the following sentence about opium as an
afterthought: &lsquo;&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s like a human creetur
so far, that you always hear what can be said against it, but
seldom what can be said in its praise.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little further on we have: &lsquo;Mr. Datchery stops in his
counting, finds he has counted wrong, shakes his money together,
and begins again.&rsquo;&nbsp; Originally we had: &lsquo;Mr.
Datchery stops in his counting, finds he has counted wrong, and
begins again.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very near the end of this chapter we
have: &lsquo;At length he rises, throws open the door of a corner
cupboard, and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its
inner side.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dickens first wrote: &lsquo;At length he
rises, throws open the door of a corner cupboard, and refers to a
few chalked strokes on its inner side.&rsquo;</p>

20</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;EXTERNAL TESTIMONIES</h3>
<p>We now proceed to give such external testimony as exists of
the plans and intentions of Dickens.&nbsp; The chief authority
is, of course, the <i>Life</i> by Forster.&nbsp; We have in
addition the testimony of Madame Perugini, whose first husband,
Charles Allston Collins, designed the wrapper.&nbsp; To this we
add the testimony of Charles Dickens the younger as conveyed to
his sister.&nbsp; Through the kindness of Miss Bessie Hatton I
have been able to read the text of the unacted play written by
Joseph Hatton and Charles Dickens the younger on <i>The Mystery
of Edwin Drood</i>.&nbsp; We have also the important letter of
Sir Luke Fildes, who was chosen by Dickens to illustrate the
story.&nbsp; It seems essential to any complete consideration of
the subject that these testimonies should be given in full, and
this is the more necessary because some of them are now not
readily at hand.</p>
<h4><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>JOHN
FORSTER&rsquo;S TESTIMONY</h4>
<p>Dickens in 1868 had been alarming his friends and exhausting
himself by his public Readings.&nbsp; When he was in America on
his last Reading tour he had made a profit of about
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; He entered into an agreement with Messrs.
Chappell to give a final course of Readings in this country, from
which he expected to receive an additional &pound;13,000.&nbsp;
The strain of his work in America had manifestly told upon
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was manifest abatement of his natural
force, the elasticity of bearing was impaired, and the wonderful
brightness of eye was dimmed at times.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfavourable
and alarming symptoms of nerve mischief were also noted, but he
drew lavishly on his reserve strength, and thinking that a new
excitement was needed he chose the <i>Oliver Twist</i> murder,
one of the most trying of his public recitals.&nbsp; He suffered
&lsquo;thirty thousand shocks to the nerves&rsquo; going to
Edinburgh.&nbsp; His Readings and his journeyings exacted from
him the most terrible physical exertion, but no warnings could
arrest his course till his physicians peremptorily ordered him to
desist.&nbsp; Even then, however, he resumed his Readings at a
later date.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>In this
condition of mental and bodily fatigue Dickens began his last
book.&nbsp; I print almost in full the relative passages from
Forster.</p>
<blockquote><p>The last book undertaken by Dickens was to be
published in illustrated monthly numbers, of the old form, but to
close with the twelfth.&nbsp; It closed, unfinished, with the
sixth number, which was itself underwritten by two pages.</p>
<p>His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter in the
middle of July.&nbsp; &lsquo;What should you think of the idea of
a story beginning in this way?&mdash;Two people, boy and girl, or
very young, going apart from one another, pledged to be married
after many years&mdash;at the end of the book.&nbsp; The interest
to arise out of the tracing of their separate ways, and the
impossibility of telling what will be done with that impending
fate.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was laid aside; but it left a marked
trace on the story as afterwards designed, in the position of
Edwin Drood and his betrothed.</p>
<p>I first heard of the later design in a letter dated
&lsquo;Friday, the 6th of August 1869,&rsquo; in which, after
speaking, with the usual unstinted praise he bestowed always on
what moved him in others, of a little tale he had received for
his journal, he spoke of the change that had occurred to him for
the new tale by himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I laid aside the fancy I
told you of, and have a very curious and new idea for my new
story.&nbsp; Not a communicable idea (or the interest of the book
would be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to
work.&rsquo;&nbsp; The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was
to be <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that
of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the originality of which
was to consist in the review of the murderer&rsquo;s career by
himself at the close, when its temptations were to be dwelt upon
as if, not he, the culprit, but some other man, were the
tempted.&nbsp; The last chapters were to be written in the
condemned cell, to which his wickedness, all elaborately elicited
from him as if told of another, had brought him.&nbsp; Discovery
by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder for its
object, was to follow hard upon commission of the deed; but all
discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till towards the
close, when, by means of a gold ring which had resisted the
corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body,
not only the person murdered was to be identified, but the
locality of the crime and the man who committed it.&nbsp; So much
was told to me before any of the book was written; and it will be
recollected that the ring, taken by Drood to be given to his
betrothed only if their engagement went on, was brought away with
him from their last interview.&nbsp; Rosa was to marry Tartar,
and Crisparkle the sister of Landless, who was himself, I think,
to have perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize
the murderer.</p>
<p>Nothing had been written, however, of the main parts of the
design excepting what is found in the published numbers; there
was no hint or preparation for the sequel in any notes of
chapters in advance; and there remained not even what he had
himself so sadly written of the book by Thackeray also
interrupted by death.&nbsp; The evidence of matured designs never
to be accomplished, intentions planned never <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>to be
executed, roads of thought marked out never to be traversed,
goals shining in the distance never to be reached, was wanting
here.&nbsp; It was all a blank.&nbsp; Enough had been completed
nevertheless to give promise of a much greater book than its
immediate predecessor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope his book is
finished,&rsquo; wrote Longfellow, when the news of his death was
flashed to America.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is certainly one of his most
beautiful works, if not the most beautiful of all.&nbsp; It would
be too sad to think the pen had fallen from his hand, and left it
incomplete.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some of its characters are touched with
subtlety, and in its descriptions his imaginative power was at
its best.&nbsp; Not a line was wanting to the reality, in the
most minute local detail, of places the most widely contrasted;
and we saw with equal vividness the lazy cathedral town and the
lurid opium-eater&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; Something like the old
lightness and buoyancy of animal spirits gave a new freshness to
the humour; the scenes of the child-heroine and her luckless
betrothed had both novelty and nicety of character in them; and
Mr. Grewgious in chambers with his clerk and the two waiters, the
conceited fool Sapsea, and the blustering philanthropist
Honeythunder, were first-rate comedy.&nbsp; Miss Twinkleton was
of the family of Miss La Creevy; and the lodging-house keeper,
Miss Billickin, though she gave Miss Twinkleton but a sorry
account of her blood, had that of Mrs. Todgers in her
veins.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was put in early life to a very genteel
boarding-school, the mistress being no less a lady than yourself,
of about your own age, or it may be some years younger, and a
poorness of blood flowed from the table which has run through <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>my
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was ever anything better said of a school-fare
of starved gentility?</p>
<p>The last page of <i>Edwin Drood</i> was written in the
ch&acirc;let in the afternoon of his last day of consciousness;
and I have thought there might be some interest in a facsimile of
the greater part of this final page of manuscript that ever came
from his hand, at which he had worked unusually late in order to
finish the chapter.&nbsp; It has very much the character, in its
excessive care of correction and interlineation, of all his later
manuscripts; and in order that comparison may be made with his
earlier and easier method, I place beside it a portion of a page
of the original of <i>Oliver Twist</i>.&nbsp; His greater pains
and elaboration of writing, it may be mentioned, become first
very obvious in the later parts of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>; but
not the least remarkable feature in all his manuscripts is the
accuracy with which the portions of each representing the several
numbers are exactly adjusted to the space the printer has to
fill.&nbsp; Whether without erasure or so interlined as to be
illegible, nothing is wanting, and there is nothing in
excess.&nbsp; So assured had the habit become, that we have seen
him remarking upon an instance the other way, in <i>Our Mutual
Friend</i>, as not having happened to him for thirty years.&nbsp;
Certainly the exceptions had been few and unimportant; but
<i>Edwin Drood</i> more startlingly showed him how unsettled the
habit he most prized had become, in the clashing of old and new
pursuits.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I had written&rsquo; (22nd of
December 1869), &lsquo;and, as I thought, disposed of the first
two numbers of my story, Clowes informed me to my horror that
they were, together, <i>twelve printed </i><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span><i>pages too
short</i>!&nbsp; Consequently I had to transpose a chapter from
number two to number one, and remodel number two
altogether.&nbsp; This was the more unlucky, that it came upon me
at the time when I was obliged to leave the book, in order to get
up the Readings&rsquo; (the additional twelve for which Sir
Thomas Watson&rsquo;s consent had been obtained); &lsquo;quite
gone out of my mind since I left them off.&nbsp; However, I
turned to it and got it done, and both numbers are now in
type.&nbsp; Charles Collins has designed an excellent
cover.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was his wish that his son-in-law should
have illustrated the story; but this not being practicable, upon
an opinion expressed by Mr. Millais which the result thoroughly
justified, choice was made of Mr. S. L. Fildes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forster goes on to explain as follows the discovery of the
manuscript containing the passage &lsquo;How Mr. Sapsea Ceased to
be a Member of the Eight Club.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is to be found
in every edition of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, but Forster&rsquo;s
remarks are important and must be reproduced:</p>
<blockquote><p>This reference to the last effort of
Dickens&rsquo;s genius had been written as it thus stands, when a
discovery of some interest was made by the writer.&nbsp; Within
the leaves of one of Dickens&rsquo;s other manuscripts were found
some detached slips of his writing, on paper only half the size
of that used for the tale, so cramped, interlined, and blotted as
to be nearly illegible, which on close inspection proved to be a
scene in which Sapsea the auctioneer is introduced as the
principal <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>figure, among a group of characters new to the
story.&nbsp; The explanation of it perhaps is, that, having
become a little nervous about the course of the tale, from a fear
that he might have plunged too soon into the incidents leading on
to the catastrophe, such as the Datchery assumption in the fifth
number (a misgiving he had certainly expressed to his
sister-in-law), it had occurred to him to open some fresh veins
of character incidental to the interest, though not directly part
of it, and so to handle them in connection with Sapsea as a
little to suspend the final development even while assisting to
strengthen it.&nbsp; Before beginning any number of a serial, he
used, as we have seen in former instances, to plan briefly what
he intended to put into it chapter by chapter; and his first
number-plan of <i>Drood</i> had the following: &lsquo;Mr.
Sapsea.&nbsp; Old Tory jackass.&nbsp; Connect Jasper with
him.&nbsp; (He will want a solemn donkey by and by)&rsquo;; which
was effected by bringing together both Durdles and Jasper, for
connection with Sapsea, in the matter of the epitaph for Mrs.
Sapsea&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; The scene now discovered might in this
view have been designed to strengthen and carry forward that
element in the tale; and otherwise it very sufficiently expresses
itself.&nbsp; It would supply an answer, if such were needed, to
those who have asserted that the hopeless decadence of Dickens as
a writer had set in before his death.&nbsp; Among the lines last
written by him, these are the very last we can ever hope to
receive; and they seem to me a delightful specimen of the power
possessed by him in his prime, and the rarest which any novelist
can have, of revealing a character by a touch.&nbsp; Here are a
couple of people, <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Kimber and Peartree, not known to us before, whom we
read off thoroughly in a dozen words; and as to Sapsea himself,
auctioneer and mayor of Cloisterham, we are face to face with
what before we only dimly realised, and we see the solemn
jackass, in his business pulpit, playing off the airs of Mr. Dean
in his Cathedral pulpit, with Cloisterham laughing at the
impostor.&rsquo;</p>

<h4>MADAME PERUGINI&rsquo;S TESTIMONY</h4>
<p>Madame Perugini&rsquo;s article appeared in the <i>Pall Mall
Magazine</i> for June 1906.&nbsp; The title is &lsquo;Edwin Drood
and the Last Days of Charles Dickens, by his younger daughter
Kate Perugini.&rsquo;&nbsp; Madame Perugini begins by summarising
the evidence of Forster as already given.&nbsp; She proceeds to
make the following instructive comments.&nbsp; It will be
observed also that she makes no additions to the external
evidence, particularly on the vexed question of the wrapper:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> is a story, or,
to speak more correctly, the half of a story, that has excited so
much general interest and so many speculations as to its ultimate
disclosures, that it has given rise to various imaginary theories
on the part of several clever writers; and to much discussion
among those who are not writers, but merely fervent admirers and
thoughtful readers of my father&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp; All these
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>attach
different meanings to the extraordinary number of clues my father
has offered them to follow, and they are even more keen at the
present day than they were when the book made its first
appearance to find their way through the tangled maze and arrive
at the very heart of the mystery.&nbsp; Among the numerous books,
pamphlets, and articles that have been written upon <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, there are some that are extremely interesting and well
worth attention, for they contain many clever and possible
suggestions, and although they do not entirely convince us, yet
they add still more to the almost painful anxiety we all feel in
wandering through the lonely precincts of Cloisterham Cathedral,
or along the banks of the river that runs through Cloisterham
town and leads to the Weir of which we are told in the story.</p>
<p>In following these writers to the end of their subtle
imaginings as to how the mystery might be solved, we may
sometimes be inclined to pause for an instant and ask ourselves
whether my father did not perhaps intend his story to have an
ending less complicated, although quite as interesting, as any
that are suggested.&nbsp; We find ourselves turning to John
Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life of Charles Dickens</i> to help us in our
perplexity, and this is what we read in his chapter headed
&lsquo;Last Book.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Forster begins by telling us
that <i>Edwin Drood</i> was to be published in twelve illustrated
monthly parts, and that it closed prematurely with the sixth
number, which was itself underwritten by two pages; therefore my
father had exactly six numbers and two pages to write when he
left his little ch&acirc;let in the shrubbery of Gad&rsquo;s Hill
Place on 8th June 1870, to <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>which he never returned.&nbsp; Mr.
Forster goes on to say: &lsquo;His first fancy for the tale was
expressed in July (meaning the July of 1869), in a letter which
runs thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What should you think of the idea of a story
beginning in this way?&mdash;Two people, boy and girl, or very
young, going apart from one another, pledged to be married after
many years&mdash;at the end of the book.&nbsp; The interest to
arise out of the tracing of their separate ways and the
impossibility of telling what will be done with that impending
fate.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>This idea my father relinquished, although he left distinct
traces of it in his tale; and in a letter to Mr. Forster, dated
6th August 1869, tells him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I laid aside the fancy I told you of, and have a very
curious and new idea for my new story.&nbsp; Not a communicable
idea (or the interest of the book would be gone), but a very
strong one, though difficult to work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Forster then says that he immediately afterwards learnt
that the story was to be &lsquo;the murder of a nephew by his
uncle&rsquo;; the originality of which was to consist in the
review of the murderer&rsquo;s career by himself at the close,
when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if not he, the
culprit, but some other man, were the tempted.&nbsp; The last
chapters were to be written in the condemned cell, to which his
wickedness, all elaborately elicited from him as if told of
another, had brought him.&nbsp; Discovery by the murderer of the
utter needlessness of the murder for its object, was to follow
hard upon commission of the deed; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>but all discovery of the murderer was
to be baffled till towards the close, when, by means of a gold
ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into
which he had thrown the body, not only the person murdered was to
be identified, but the locality of the crime and the man who
committed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Forster adds a little information as to the marriages at
the close of the book, and makes use of the expression &lsquo;I
think&rsquo; in speaking of Neville Landless, as though he were
not quite certain of what he remembered concerning him.&nbsp;
This &lsquo;I think&rsquo; has been seized upon by some of Mr.
Forster&rsquo;s critics, who appear to argue that because he did
not clearly recollect one detail of the story he may therefore
have been mistaken in the whole.&nbsp; But we see for ourselves
that Mr. Forster is perfectly well informed as to the nature of
the plot, and the fate of the two principal characters concerned,
the murdered and the murderer; and the only thing upon which he
is not positive is the ending of Neville Landless, to which he
confesses in the words &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; thus making his
testimony to the more important facts the more impressive.&nbsp;
If we have any doubts as to whether Mr. Forster correctly stated
what he was told, we have only to turn to the story of <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, and we find, as far as it goes, that his statement is
entirely corroborated by what we read in the book.</p>
<p>If those who are interested in the subject will carefully read
what I have quoted, they will not be able to detect any word or
hint from my father that it was upon the Mystery alone that he
relied for the interest and originality of his idea.&nbsp; The
originality was to be <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>shown, as he tells us, in what we may
call the psychological description the murderer gives us of his
temptations, temperament, and character, as if told by another;
and my father speaks openly of the ring to Mr. Forster.&nbsp;
Moreover, he refers to it often in his story, and we all
recognise it, whatever our other convictions may be, as the
instrument by which Jasper&rsquo;s wickedness and guilt are to be
established in the end.&nbsp; I do not mean to imply that the
mystery itself had no strong hold on my father&rsquo;s
imagination; but, greatly as he was interested in the intricacies
of that tangled skein, the information he voluntarily gave to Mr.
Forster, from whom he had withheld nothing for thirty-three
years, certainly points to the fact that he was quite as deeply
fascinated and absorbed in the study of the criminal Jasper, as
in the dark and sinister crime that has given the book its
title.&nbsp; And he also speaks to Mr. Forster of the murder of a
nephew by an uncle.&nbsp; He does not say that he is uncertain
whether he shall save the nephew, but has evidently made up his
mind that the crime is to be committed.&nbsp; And so he told his
plot to Mr. Forster, as he had been accustomed to tell his plots
for years past; and those who knew him must feel it impossible to
believe that in this, the last year of his life, he should
suddenly become underhand, and we might say treacherous, to his
old friend, by inventing for his private edification a plot that
he had no intention of carrying into execution.&nbsp; This is
incredible, and the nature of the friendship that existed between
Mr. Forster and himself makes the idea unworthy of
consideration.</p>
<p>Mr. Forster was devotedly attached to my father, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>but as years
passed by this engrossing friendship made him a little jealous of
his confidence, and more than a little exacting in his demands
upon it.&nbsp; My father was perfectly aware of this weakness in
his friend, and although the knowledge of it made him smile at
times, and even joke about it when we were at home and alone, he
was always singularly tenderhearted where Mr. Forster was
concerned, and was particularly careful never to wound the very
sensitive nature of one who, from the first moment of their
acquaintance, had devoted his time and energy to making my
father&rsquo;s path in life as smooth as so intricate a path
could be made.&nbsp; In all business transactions Mr. Forster
acted for him, and generally brought him through these troubles
triumphantly, whereas, if left to himself, his impetuosity and
impatience might have spoilt all chances of success; while in all
his private troubles my father instinctively turned to his
friend, and even when not invariably following his advice, had
yet so much confidence in his judgment as to be rendered not only
uneasy but unhappy if Mr. Forster did not approve of the decision
at which he ultimately arrived.&nbsp; From the beginning of their
friendship to the end of my father&rsquo;s life the relations
between the two friends remained unchanged; and the notion that
has been spread abroad that my father wilfully misled Mr. Forster
in what he told him of the plot of <i>Edwin Drood</i> should be
abandoned, as it does not correspond with the knowledge of those
who understood the dignity of my father&rsquo;s character, and
were also aware of the perfectly frank terms upon which he lived
with Mr. Forster.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>If my
father again changed his plan for the story of <i>Edwin Drood</i>
the first thing he would naturally do would be to write to Mr.
Forster and inform him of the alteration.&nbsp; We might imagine
for an instant that he would perhaps desire to keep the change as
a surprise for his friend, but what I have just stated with
regard to Mr. Forster&rsquo;s character renders this supposition
out of the question, as my father knew for a certainty that his
jealousy would debar him from appreciating such a surprise, and
that he would in all probability strongly resent what he might
with justice be allowed to consider as a piece of unnecessary
caution on my father&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; That he did not write to
Mr. Forster to tell him of any divergence from his second plan
for the book we all know, and we know also that my eldest
brother, Charles, positively declared that he had heard from his
father&rsquo;s lips that Edwin Drood was dead.&nbsp; Here,
therefore, are two very important witnesses to a fact that is
still doubted by those who never met my father, and were never
impressed by the grave sincerity with which he would have given
this assurance.</p>
<p>It is very often those who most doubt Mr. Forster&rsquo;s
accuracy on this point who are in the habit of turning to his
book when they are in the search of facts to establish some
theory of their own; and they do not hesitate to do this, because
they know that whatever views they may hold upon the work itself,
or the manner in which it is written, absolute truth is to be
found in its pages.&nbsp; Why should they refuse, therefore, to
believe a statement made upon one page of his three volumes, when
they willingly and gratefully <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>accept the rest if it is to their
interest to do so?&nbsp; This is a difficult question to answer,
but it is not without importance when we are discussing the
subject of <i>Edwin Drood</i>.&nbsp; On pages 425 and 426 of the
third volume of Mr. Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> is to be found
the simple explanation of my father&rsquo;s plot for his story,
as given to him by my father himself.&nbsp; It is true that Mr.
Forster speaks from remembrance, but how often does he not speak
from remembrance, and yet how seldom are we inclined to doubt his
word?&nbsp; Only here, because what he tells us does not exactly
fit in with our preconceived views as to how the tale shall be
finished, are we disposed to quarrel with him, for the simple
reason that we flatter ourselves we have discovered a better
ending to the book than the one originally intended for it by the
author.&nbsp; And so we put his statement aside and ignore it,
while we grope in the dark for a thing we shall never find; and
we obstinately refuse to allow even the little glimmer of light
my father has himself thrown upon the obscurity to help us in our
search.&nbsp; It was not, I imagine, for the intricate working
out of his plot alone that my father cared to write this story;
but it was through his wonderful observation of character, and
his strange insight into the tragic secrets of the human heart,
that he desired his greatest triumph to be achieved.</p>
<p>I do not write upon these things because I have any fresh or
startling theories to offer upon the subject of <i>Edwin
Drood</i>.&nbsp; I cannot say that I am without my own opinions,
but I am fully conscious that after what has been already so ably
said, they would have but little interest for the general public;
so I shrink <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>from venturing upon any suggestions respecting the
solution of my father&rsquo;s last book.&nbsp; My chief object in
writing is to remind the readers of this paper that there are
certain facts connected with this story that cannot lightly be
put aside, and these facts are to be found in John
Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life of Charles Dickens</i>, and in the
declaration made by my brother Charles.&nbsp; Having known both
Mr. Forster and my brother intimately, I cannot for a moment
believe that either of them would speak or write that which he
did not know to be strictly true; and it is on these grounds
alone that I think I have a right to be heard when I insist upon
the assertion that Edwin Drood was undoubtedly murdered by his
uncle Jasper.&nbsp; As to the unravelling of the mystery, and the
way in which the murder was perpetrated, we are all at liberty to
have our own views, seeing that no explanations were as yet
arrived at in the story; but we should remember that only vague
speculations can be indulged in when we try to imagine them for
ourselves.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out, and very justly, that although Jasper
removed the watch, chain, and scarf-pin from Edwin&rsquo;s body,
there would possibly remain on it money of some kind, keys, and
the metal buttons on his clothes, which the action of the
quicklime could not destroy, and by which his identity would be
made known.&nbsp; This has been looked upon as an oversight, a
mere piece of forgetfulness on my father&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; But
remembering, as I do very well, what he often said, that the most
clever criminals were constantly detected through some small
defect in their calculations, I cannot but think it most probable
that this was not <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>an oversight, but was intended to lead up to the pet
theory that he so frequently mentioned whenever a murder case was
brought to trial.&nbsp; After reading <i>Edwin Drood</i> many
times, as most of us have read it, we must, I think, come to the
conclusion that not a word of this tale was written without full
consideration; that in this story at least my father left nothing
to chance, and that therefore the money, and the buttons, were
destined to take their proper place in the book, and might turn
out to be a weak spot in Jasper&rsquo;s well-arranged and
complicated plot, <i>the</i> weak spot my father insisted upon,
as being inseparable from the commission of a great crime,
however skilfully planned.&nbsp; The keys spoken of need not be
taken seriously into account, for Edwin was a careless young
fellow, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that he did not
always carry them upon his person; he was staying with his uncle,
and he may have left them in the portmanteau, which was most
likely at the time of the murder lying unfastened in his room,
with the key belonging to it in the lock.&nbsp; It would be
unfair to suggest that my father wrote unadvisedly of this or
that, for he had still the half of his story to finish, and
plenty of time, as he thought, in which to gather up the broken
threads and weave them into a symmetrical and harmonious whole,
which he was so eminently capable of completing.</p>
<p>That my father&rsquo;s brain was more than usually clear and
bright during the writing of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, no one who lived
with him could possibly doubt; and the extraordinary interest he
took in the development of this story was apparent in all that he
said or did, and <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>was often the subject of conversation between those who
anxiously watched him as he wrote, and feared that he was trying
his strength too far.&nbsp; For although my father&rsquo;s death
was sudden and unexpected, the knowledge that his bodily health
was failing had been for some time too forcibly brought to the
notice of those who loved him, for them to be blind to the fact
that the book he was now engaged in, and the concentration of his
devotion and energy upon it, were a tax too great for his
fast-ebbing strength.&nbsp; Any attempt to stay him, however, in
work that he had undertaken was as idle as stretching one&rsquo;s
hands to a river and bidding it cease to flow; and beyond a few
remonstrances now and again urged, no such attempt was made,
knowing as we did that it would be entirely useless.&nbsp; And so
the work sped on, carrying with it my father&rsquo;s few
remaining days of life, and the end came all too soon, as it was
bound to come, to one who never ceased to labour for those who
were dear to him, in the hope of gaining for them that which he
was destined never to enjoy.&nbsp; And in my father&rsquo;s grave
lies buried the secret of his story.</p>
<p>The scene of the Eight Club, which Mr. Forster discovered
after his death, in which there figure two new characters, Mr.
Peartree and Mr. Kimber, bears no relation as we read it to the
unfolding of the plot; and although the young man Poker, who is
also introduced in this fragment for the first time, seems to be
of more significance, we see too little of him to be certain that
we may not already have made his acquaintance.&nbsp; In Mr.
Sapsea my father evidently took much pleasure, and we are here
reminded of <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>the note made for him in the first number-plan of
<i>Edwin Drood</i>: &lsquo;Mr. Sapsea.&nbsp; Old Tory
jackass.&nbsp; Connect Jasper with him.&nbsp; (He will want a
solemn donkey by and by.)&rsquo;&nbsp; My father also wanted the
solemn donkey, and not only brought him in for the purposes of
his story, but because, as in the case of &lsquo;the
Billickin,&rsquo; he took delight in dwelling upon the
absurdities of the character.</p>
<p>As to the cover of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, that has been the
subject of so much discussion there is very little to tell.&nbsp;
It was designed and drawn by Mr. Charles A. Collins, my first
husband.&nbsp; The same reasons that prevented me from teasing my
father with questions respecting his story made me refrain from
asking any of Mr. Collins; but from what he said I certainly
gathered that he was not in possession of my father&rsquo;s
secret, although he had made his designs from my father&rsquo;s
directions.&nbsp; There are a few things in this cover that I
fancy have been a little misunderstood.&nbsp; In the book only
Jasper and Neville Landless are described as dark young
men.&nbsp; Edwin Drood is fair, and so is Crisparkle.&nbsp;
Tartar is burnt by the sun; but when Rosa asks &lsquo;the
Unlimited head chambermaid&rsquo; at the hotel in
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn if the gentleman who has just called is
dark, she replies:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss, more of a brown gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure not with black hair?&rsquo; asked Rosa,
taking courage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure of that, Miss.&nbsp; Brown hair and blue
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now in a drawing it would be difficult to make a <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>distinction
between the fair hair of Edwin and the slightly darker hair of
Tartar; and in the picture, where we see a girl&mdash;Rosa we
imagine her to be&mdash;seated in a garden, the young man at her
feet is, I feel pretty sure, intended for Tartar.&nbsp; Edwin it
cannot be, nor Neville, as has been supposed, for he was
decidedly dark.&nbsp; Besides this, Neville would not have told
his affection to Rosa, for Helena was far too quick-witted not to
understand from Rosa&rsquo;s first mention of Tartar that she is
already in love with him, and she would have warned and saved the
brother to whom she was so ardently attached from making any such
confession.&nbsp; The figure is not intended for Jasper, because
we know that Jasper did not move from the sun-dial in the scene
where he declares his mad passion for Rosa, and Jasper had black
hair and whiskers.&nbsp; And, again, the drawing cannot be meant
to represent Helena and Crisparkle, for the young man is not in
clerical dress.&nbsp; The figures going up the stairs are still
more difficult to make out; but there can be little doubt that
the active higher one is the same young man we see at
Rosa&rsquo;s feet, and must therefore be Tartar.&nbsp; Of the
remaining two, one may be Crisparkle, although there is still no
clerical attire, and the other either Grewgious or Neville,
though the drawing certainly bears but little resemblance to
either of those characters.</p>
<p>The lower and middle picture is, of course, the great scene of
the book; but whether the young man standing calm, and inexorable
as Fate, is intended to be the ghost of Edwin as seen by Jasper
in his half-dazed and drugged condition, or whether it is <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Helena
dressed as Datchery, as one writer has ingeniously suggested
(although there are reasons in the story against the supposition
that Helena is Datchery, and many to support the theory that the
&lsquo;old buffer&rsquo; is Bazzard),&mdash;these are puzzles
that will never be cleared up, except to the minds of those who
have positively determined that they hold the clue to the
mystery, and can only see its interpretation from one point of
view.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s figure with streaming hair, in the
picture where the word &lsquo;Lost&rsquo; is written, has been
supposed to represent Rosa after her parting from Edwin; but it
may more likely, I think, indicate some scene in the book which
has yet to be described in the story.&nbsp; This is another
enigma; but my father, it may be presumed, intended to puzzle his
readers by the cover, and he had every legitimate right to do so,
for had his meaning been made perfectly clear &lsquo;the interest
of the book would be gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some surprise has been
expressed because Mr. Forster did not ask Mr. Collins for the
meaning of his designs; but if he already knew the plot, why
should he seek information from Mr. Collins? particularly as my
father may have told him that he had not disclosed the secret of
his story to his illustrators, for I believe I am right in
affirming that Mr. Luke Fildes was no better informed as to the
plan of the book than was Mr. Collins.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>I am unfortunately not acquainted with much that
has been written about <i>Edwin Drood</i>, for the story was so
painfully associated with my father&rsquo;s death and the sorrow
of that time that after first reading it I <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>could never
bear to look into the book again till about two months ago, when
I found myself obliged to do so; and then my thoughts flew back
to the last occasion when my father mentioned it in my
hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>There is one other fact connected with my father and <i>Edwin
Drood</i> that I think my readers would like to know, and I must
be forgiven if I again speak from my own experience in order to
relate it.&nbsp; Upon reading the book once more, as I have
already told, after an interval of a great number of years, the
story took such entire possession of me that for a long time I
could think of nothing else; and one day, my aunt, Miss Hogarth,
being with me, I asked her if she knew anything more definite
than I did as to how the ending was to be brought about.&nbsp;
For I should explain that when my father was unusually reticent
we seldom, if ever, attempted to break his silence by remarks or
hints that might lead him to suppose that we were anxious to
learn what he had no doubt good reasons for desiring to keep from
us.&nbsp; And we made it a point of honour among ourselves never,
in talking to him on the subject of <i>Edwin Drood</i>, to show
the impatience we naturally felt to arrive at the end of so
engrossing a tale.</p>
<p>My aunt said that she knew absolutely nothing, but she told me
that shortly before my father&rsquo;s death, and after he had
been speaking of some difficulty he was in with his work, without
explaining what it was, she found it impossible to refrain from
asking him, &lsquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t really killed poor
Edwin Drood?&rsquo;&nbsp; To which he gravely replied, &lsquo;I
call my book the <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Mystery, not the History, of Edwin Drood.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And that was all he would answer.&nbsp; My aunt could not make
out from the reply, or from his manner of giving it, whether he
wished to convey that the Mystery was to remain a mystery for
ever, or if he desired gently to remind her that he would not
disclose his secret until the proper time arrived for telling
it.&nbsp; But I think his words are so suggestive, and may carry
with them so much meaning, that I offer them now, with my
aunt&rsquo;s permission, to those who take a delight in trying to
unravel the impenetrable secrets of a story that has within its
sadly shortened pages a most curious fascination, and is
&lsquo;gifted with invincible force to hold and drag.&rsquo;</p>

<h4>THE TESTIMONY OF CHARLES DICKENS THE YOUNGER</h4>
<p>I have quoted from Madame Perugini&rsquo;s statement the
words: &lsquo;We know also that my elder brother Charles
positively declared that he had heard from his father&rsquo;s
lips that Edwin Drood was dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; I proceed to
corroborate the statement by giving here a brief account of the
play by Joseph Hatton and Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>The importance of this play as a witness to Dickens&rsquo;s
intentions is shown in an article by Joseph Hatton which appeared
in the <i>People</i> on 19th November 1905.&nbsp; Mr. Hatton
explains that about the year 1880, in a conversation, he sketched
out his idea of the play up to the <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>crucial point.&nbsp; Dickens had a
play in his mind when he wrote the story, and it was said that he
had thought of Dion Boucicault as his collaborator in his work
for the stage.&nbsp; After the death of Dickens, Boucicault had a
mind to write the play and invent his own conclusion to the
story, but afterwards gave it up.&nbsp; Mr. Hatton, in a
conversation with Mr. Luke Fildes, saw Dickens&rsquo;s possible
conclusion, but did not attempt to gather up the broken
threads.&nbsp; &lsquo;Consulting his son, Charles, to whom I
offered my sketch, I found that his father had revealed to him
sufficient of the plot to clearly indicate how the story was to
end.&nbsp; We agreed to write the play.&nbsp; Much of the
son&rsquo;s version of the finale was proved by the instructions
which the author had given to the illustrator in regard to
certain of the unpublished and unwritten chapters.&nbsp; And so
Dickens the younger and I fell to work and wrote the play of
<i>Edwin Drood</i> for the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He goes on to explain that the piece was cast, and a great point
made of the authoritative conclusion of the story, thus clearing
up something of the mystery which was part of its title.&nbsp;
But Mr. Harry Jackson, the stage manager, did not like the play,
and it was left unacted.&nbsp; Years <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>after, Dickens had a hope that Mr.
Willard would undertake the play, but this expectation was not
fulfilled.&nbsp; Dickens consoled himself by saying that next to
the pleasure of having a good play acted was the pleasure of
writing it, and for the rest he took the incident as one of the
&lsquo;little ironies&rsquo; of his life.</p>
<p>The play as it lies before me is in four Acts.&nbsp; The first
is made up of conversations between the Landlesses, Mrs.
Crisparkle, Septimus Crisparkle, Rosa and Edwin.&nbsp; These are
practically repeated from the book.&nbsp; Grewgious and Jasper
then come on the scene, the novel being closely followed in their
conversation.&nbsp; The second Act is made up of conversations
also mainly reproduced from the book between Helena and Rosa,
Jasper and Crisparkle.&nbsp; Grewgious comes on in the second
Scene where Edwin and Rosa decide to be brother and sister.&nbsp;
There follow in the third Scene the talks between Jasper and
Durdles.&nbsp; Edwin talks to the opium woman, and Jasper appears
with the scarf on his arm.&nbsp; So far there is practically
nothing that is not taken directly from Dickens.&nbsp; The third
Act opens with a conversation between Septimus and Mrs.
Crisparkle as to the guilt of Landless.&nbsp; Helena and Neville
appear <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>protesting innocence.&nbsp; Grewgious tells Jasper about
the breaking of the engagement between Edwin and Rosa.&nbsp;
Jasper makes love to Rosa.&nbsp; In the concluding Act the scene
is laid in the opium den in London: &lsquo;Dark,
poverty-stricken.&nbsp; Fourpost bedstead, chair, table,
candlestick, set well down so as to allow good space for vision
later on, light up a little, when Opium Sal lights candle shortly
after Jasper&rsquo;s entrance.&nbsp; For details see
Fildes&rsquo;s picture in book.&nbsp; Opium Sal discovered moving
about in a witch-like kind of way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jasper enters and
tells Sal that a man followed him to the door.&nbsp; She lights
the opium pipe for him, and then questions him.</p>
<p>He says at last: &lsquo;Hush! the journey&rsquo;s made!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s over!&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sal</span>.&nbsp; Is it over
so soon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jasper</span>.&nbsp; I must sleep that
vision off.&nbsp; It is the poorest of all.&nbsp; No struggle, no
consciousness of peril, no entreaty, and yet I never saw
<i>that</i> before!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sal</span>.&nbsp; See what, deary?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jasper</span>.&nbsp; Look at it!&nbsp;
Look what a poor miserable thing it is!&nbsp; <i>That</i> must be
real.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>(<i>He has accompanied this incoherence with some wild
unmeaning gestures</i>; <i>but they trail off into the
progressive inaction of stupor</i>, <i>and he lies like a log
upon the bed</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> <span

</blockquote>
<p>Edwin, Jasper, and Neville are talking.&nbsp; Edwin says he
will walk with Neville as far as the river and have a look at the
storm.&nbsp; Neville and Jasper exchange good-nights, and Edwin
says: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go to bed, Jack, I won&rsquo;t be

<h4>THE TESTIMONY OF SIR LUKE FILDES</h4>
<p>A reviewer in the <i>Times</i> Literary Supplement, 27th
October 1905, wrote: &lsquo;Nor do we attach much importance to
any of the hints Dickens dropped, whether to John Forster, to any
member of his family, or to either of his illustrators.&nbsp; He
was very anxious that his secret should not be guessed, and the
hints which he dropped may very well have been intentionally <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>misleading.&rsquo;&nbsp; This called forth the following
letter from Sir Luke Fildes:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">TO THE EDITOR OF THE
TIMES</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;In an article entitled &lsquo;The Mysteries of
Edwin Drood&rsquo; in your issue of to-day, the writer,
speculating on the various theories advanced as solutions of the
mystery, ventures to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor do we attach much importance to any of the hints
Dickens dropped, whether to John Forster, to any member of his
family, or to either of his illustrators.&nbsp; He was very
anxious that his secret should not be guessed, and the hints
which he dropped may very well have been intentionally
misleading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know that Charles Dickens was very anxious that his secret
should not be guessed, but it surprises me to read that he could
be thought capable of the deceit so lightly attributed to
him.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;hints he dropped&rsquo; to me, his sole
illustrator&mdash;for Charles Collins, his son-in-law, only
designed the green cover for the monthly parts, and Collins told
me he did not in the least know the significance of the various
groups in the design; that they were drawn from instructions
personally given by Charles Dickens, and not from any
text&mdash;these &lsquo;hints&rsquo; to me were the outcome of a
request of mine that he would explain some matters, the meaning
of which I could not comprehend, and which were for me, his
illustrator, embarrassingly hidden.</p>
<p>I instanced in the printers&rsquo; rough proof of the <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>monthly part
sent to me to illustrate where he particularly described John
Jasper as wearing a neckerchief of such dimensions as to go twice
round his neck; I called his attention to the circumstance that I
had previously dressed Jasper as wearing a little black tie once
round the neck, and I asked him if he had any special reasons for
the alteration of Jasper&rsquo;s attire, and, if so, I submitted
I ought to know.&nbsp; He, Dickens, appeared for the moment to be
disconcerted by my remark, and said something meaning he was
afraid he was &lsquo;getting on too fast&rsquo; and revealing
more than he meant at that early stage, and after a short
silence, cogitating, he suddenly said, &lsquo;Can you keep a
secret?&rsquo;&nbsp; I assured him he could rely on me.&nbsp; He
then said, &lsquo;I must have the double necktie!&nbsp; It is
necessary, for Jasper strangles Edwin Drood with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was impressed by his earnestness, as indeed, I was at all my
interviews with him&mdash;also by the confidence which he said he
reposed in me, trusting that I would not in any way refer to it,
as he feared even a chance remark might find its way into the
papers &lsquo;and thus anticipate his
&ldquo;mystery&rdquo;&rsquo;; and it is a little startling, after
more than thirty-five years of profound belief in the nobility of
character and sincerity of Charles Dickens, to be told now that
he probably was more or less of a humbug on such
occasions.&mdash;I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>

69</span>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE WRAPPER</h3>
<p>Much attention has been given to the illustrations on the
wrapper and their significance.&nbsp; So far as I can find, the
question was first raised in the <i>Spectator</i>.&nbsp; On 1st
October 1870, in a review of the first edition of <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, the <i>Spectator</i> complained that the publishers
had not given a facsimile of the vignetted cover.&nbsp; The
critic proceeds: &lsquo;By whom was the lamplight discovery of a
standing figure, apparently meant for Edwin Drood, in the
vignette at the bottom of the page, intended to be
made?&rsquo;&nbsp; He inquired also whether the man entering with
the lanthorn was John Jasper, and what were the directions given
by Mr. Dickens as to the ascent of the winding staircase
represented on the right hand of the cover.&nbsp; The
<i>Spectator</i> asked for any authentic indications which might
exist of the turn which Dickens intended to give to the
story.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor can we see how it can be possible that no
such <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>indications exist, with this prefiguring cover to prove
that he had not only anticipated, but disclosed to some one or
other, many of the situations he intended to paint.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Since then others, and in particular Mr. Andrew Lang, have with
much insistency declared that the bottom picture represents a
meeting of the risen Edwin Drood with his horror-stricken uncle,
John Jasper.</p>
<p>In reply to these questions certain considerations may be
adduced:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We have already shown from the testimony of Charles
Allston Collins, as reported by his widow, and by Sir Luke
Fildes, that he, at least, was not aware of any such intention in
the mind of Dickens.&nbsp; On the contrary, Madame Perugini and
Sir Luke Fildes are convinced that Edwin Drood was
murdered.&nbsp; More than this, Charles Dickens the younger, who
was more or less in his father&rsquo;s confidence, agreed with
them.&nbsp; As we have noted, he affirmed that his father had
told him that Edwin Drood was murdered, and he constructed his
play on that basis.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I attach much weight to Madame Perugini&rsquo;s
suggestion that whatever her father meant or did not mean, he was
certainly not the man to give away on the cover the answer to the
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>mystery.&nbsp; He may have meant&mdash;he very probably
did&mdash;before he began the story to mystify his readers a
little.&nbsp; This is shown, I think, by the various suggested
titles printed on page 57.&nbsp; But as he rejected those titles,
it is plain that he thought them unsatisfactory, and that he
refrained from raising in the title at least the question whether
the murder of Edwin Drood was accomplished.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I had prepared materials for a chapter on the
wrappers of Dickens&rsquo;s novels as used in the monthly parts,
but it is not necessary to go into particulars.&nbsp; I am glad
to find myself in full agreement with the eminent Dickens
scholar, Mr. B W. Matz, who attaches no importance to the
covers.&nbsp; I put no trust in the wrapper of <i>Edwin Drood</i>
any more than I should in that of <i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, <i>Little Dorrit</i>, <i>Dombey and Son</i>, and
many others, for a suggestion of any intricate points in any of
their plots.&nbsp; The only covers which may be reliable in this
respect are <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and
<i>Sketches by Boz</i>.&nbsp; Each of these works was issued in
parts after their respective stories had appeared complete in
other forms.&nbsp; All the others must have been designed before
the first parts were published, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>and knowing the freedom which Dickens
allowed himself we can attach little importance to the evidence
of a particular cover as an index to the story.</p>
<p>When Mr. Marcus Stone, R.A., completed his seventy-second
year, on 4th July 1912, he was interviewed by a representative of
the <i>Morning Post</i>, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cover of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, with the
representation of different incidents in the story, I drew after
seeing an amount of matter equivalent to no more than the first
two one-shilling monthly parts.&nbsp; Here it is: you will see
that I depicted among other characters, Mr. Silas Wegg.&nbsp;
Well, I was aware that Wegg had a wooden leg, but I wanted to
know whether this was his right or his left leg, as there was
nothing in the material before me that threw light on this
point.&nbsp; To my surprise, Dickens said: &lsquo;I do not
know.&nbsp; I do not think I had identified the leg.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That was the only time I ever knew him to be at fault on a point
of this kind, for as a rule he was ready to describe down to the
minutest details the personal characteristics, and, I might
almost add, the life-history of the creations of his fancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.&nbsp; But the final proof of the impossibility of making
trustworthy deductions from the cover is to be found in the fact
that no readers read it in the same way.&nbsp; In proof of this I
give the readings of Professor Henry Jackson, Mr. <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Andrew Lang,
Dr. M. R. James, and Mr. Cuming Walters.&nbsp; Through the great
kindness of Mr. Hugh Thomson the artist, who has made a study of
this subject and has given me his results, I am able to add
another interpretation certainly of no lower authority than those
which accompany it.</p>
<h4>PROFESSOR JACKSON&rsquo;S READING</h4>
<blockquote><p>We may fairly presume that the figures in the four
corners represent comedy, tragedy, the opium-woman, and the
Chinaman.&nbsp; In the nave of the Cathedral, Edwin and Rosa pair
off against Jasper and Crisparkle.&nbsp; Despite the discrepancy
which Mr. Lang points out, I think that the lower of the two
pictures on our left shows Jasper and Rosa in the garden of the
Nuns&rsquo; House.&nbsp; In the upper side-piece, the girl is, I
am sure, Rosa flying from Jasper&rsquo;s pursuit, in full view of
a placard announcing Edwin&rsquo;s disappearance.&nbsp; It is
true that the hatless girl with her hair streaming down her back
does not answer very well to Dickens&rsquo;s description of Rosa,
and has no resemblance to Sir L. Fildes&rsquo;s pictures of her:
but if Dickens, when he had not yet thought out his conception of
her personality, told Collins to draw a frightened girl of
seventeen running away from school, no more than this could be
expected.&nbsp; For the scheme of the sketch, compare the picture
in <i>Bleak House</i>, which shows Lady Dedlock, as she mounts
the staircase, turning to look at a bill announcing a reward for
the discovery of the murderer <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of Tulkinghorn.&nbsp; That placards
and advertisements, imploring Edwin to communicate with his
uncle, had been widely circulated, we have been told at p.
182.&nbsp; On the right, the two men in the lower picture are, I
suppose, Jasper and Durdles ascending the tower on the night of
&lsquo;the unaccountable expedition&rsquo;; while the man above
is Jasper on Christmas Eve looking down at
&lsquo;<i>that</i>,&rsquo; p. 276: &lsquo;Look down, look
down!&nbsp; You see what lies at the bottom there?&rsquo; p.
274.&nbsp; I demur to Mr. Lang&rsquo;s statements that the young
man whom I venture to identify with Jasper is represented as
&lsquo;whiskerless,&rsquo; and that the figure which I take to be
Durdles is well-dressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Jackson then mentions the views of Mr. Proctor and
Mr. Lang on the important vignette at the bottom of the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>For my own part, I suspect that the upright figure
represents Drood, but that the Drood which it represents is a
phantom of Jasper&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; Let us suppose that
an advertisement for a ring known to have been in the possession
of the late Edwin Drood appears in the local newspaper, and that
Jasper, now for the first time aware of the ring&rsquo;s
existence, goes to the crypt to look for it.&nbsp; Dickens might
well suppose him at such a moment to see a vision of the murdered
man, and might instruct Collins to represent what Jasper imagined
himself to see.&nbsp; Indeed, I fancy that I recognise an
intentional contrast between the two figures: the one in the
foreground, full of movement, solidly drawn; the other, in the
background, statuesque, and a little shadowy.&nbsp; Doubtless
Dickens <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>was anxious that the reader should not know too much;
and if he made Collins give visible form to a hallucination of
Jasper&rsquo;s brain, I for one do not think the procedure
illegitimate.&nbsp; It is sad that Dickens did not live to
explain the innocent deception which, as I imagine, he meant for
a few months to practise upon his readers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MR. ANDREW LANG&rsquo;S INTERPRETATION IN &lsquo;THE PUZZLE
OF DICKENS&rsquo;S LAST PLOT&rsquo;</h4>
<blockquote><p>The cover lies before the reader.&nbsp; In the
left-hand top corner appears an allegorical female figure of joy,
with flowers.&nbsp; The central top space contains the front of
Cloisterham Cathedral, or rather, the nave.&nbsp; To the left
walks Edwin, with hyacinthine locks, and a thoroughly classical
type of face, and Grecian nose.&nbsp; <i>Like Datchery</i>, <i>he
does not wear</i>, <i>but carries his hat</i>; this means
nothing, if they are in the nave.&nbsp; He seems bored.&nbsp; On
his arm is Rosa; <i>she</i> seems bored; she trails her parasol,
and looks away from Edwin, looks down, to her right.&nbsp; On the
spectator&rsquo;s right march the surpliced men and boys of the
choir.&nbsp; Behind them is Jasper, black whiskers and all; he
stares after Edwin and Rosa; his right hand hides his
mouth.&nbsp; In the corner above him is an allegorical female,
clasping a stiletto.</p>
<p>Beneath Edwin and Rosa is, first, an allegorical female
figure, looking at a placard, headed &lsquo;LOST,&rsquo; on a
door.&nbsp; Under that again, is a girl in a garden-chair; a
young man, whiskerless, with wavy hair, kneels and kisses her
hand.&nbsp; She looks rather unimpassioned.&nbsp; I conceive the
man to be Landless, taking leave of <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Rosa after urging his hopeless suit
for which Helena, we learn, &lsquo;seems to compassionate
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has avowed his passion, early in the story,
to Crisparkle.&nbsp; Below, the opium hag is smoking.&nbsp; On
the other side, under the figures of Jasper and the choir, the
young man who kneels to the girl is seen bounding up a spiral
staircase.&nbsp; His left hand is on the iron railing; he stoops
over it, looking down at others who follow him.&nbsp; His right
hand, the index finger protruded, points upward, and, by chance
or design, points straight at Jasper in the vignette above.&nbsp;
Beneath this man (clearly Landless) follows a tall man in a
&lsquo;bowler&rsquo; hat, a &lsquo;cut-away&rsquo; coat, and
trousers which show an inch of white stocking above the low
shoes.&nbsp; His profile is hid by the wall of the spiral
staircase: he might be Grewgious of the shoes, white stockings,
and short trousers, but he may be Tartar: he takes two steps at a
stride.&nbsp; Beneath him a youngish man, in a low, soft,
clerical hat and a black pea-coat, ascends, looking downwards and
backwards.&nbsp; This is clearly Crisparkle.&nbsp; A Chinaman is
smoking opium beneath.</p>
<p>In the central lowest space, a dark and whiskered man enters a
dark chamber; his left hand is on the lock of the door; in his
right he holds up a lantern.&nbsp; The light of the lantern
reveals a young man in a soft hat of Tyrolese shape.&nbsp; His
features are purely classical, his nose is Grecian, his locks are
long (at least, according to the taste of to-day); he wears a
light paletot, buttoned to the throat; his right arm hangs by his
side; his left hand is thrust into the breast of his coat.&nbsp;
He calmly regards the dark man with the lantern.&nbsp; That man,
of course, is Jasper.&nbsp; <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>The young man is <span
class="smcap">Edwin Drood</span>, of the Grecian nose,
hyacinthine locks, and classic features, as in Sir L.
Fildes&rsquo;s third illustration.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor correctly understood the unmistakable meaning of
this last design, Jasper entering the vault:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-day the dead are living,<br />
The lost is found to-day.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>DR. JAMES&rsquo;S VIEW</h4>
<p>In the <i>Cambridge Review</i> for 9th March 1911 Dr. James
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, as to the figures at the angles and the scene
at the top there is general agreement.&nbsp; As to those on the
left, H. J. is, I think, right in calling the upper one
Rosa&rsquo;s flight; but the lower one <i>cannot</i> be Jasper
and Rosa.&nbsp; The young man has a moustache.&nbsp; Jasper had
none, and has none in the two pictures of him on this same
cover.&nbsp; Also, the artist has carefully emphasised the fact
that the girl is indifferent to her suitor.&nbsp; The figures, I
believe, represent Rosa and Neville Landless.</p>
<p>On the right, H. J. assumes that there are two scenes.&nbsp; I
am clear that there is but one: for, whereas, on the left side
the two scenes are separated by a sprig of the rose-wreath which
surrounds the centre, and a similar sprig parts them from the top
scene, there is on the right only the division from the top
scene, managed in the same way as on the left.&nbsp; And yet, had
the scene been two, there was great necessity to separate them,
inasmuch as they are taking place in the same surroundings,
namely, the winding staircase.&nbsp; As to the identity of the
three men, the lowest one is a cleric, Crisparkle, <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the next
above him I will not identify; the uppermost is either Jasper or
just possibly (since he is pointing pretty directly at the figure
of Jasper in the top scene, and seems to be acting as a guide to
those below him) Datchery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. James dissents from Dr. Jackson as to the central vignette
at the bottom.&nbsp; No phantom of the imagination is
there.&nbsp; We have a real person, as is shown by the fact that
he casts a shadow on the wall behind him.</p>
<h4>MR. HUGH THOMSON&rsquo;S READING</h4>
<p>Mr. Hugh Thomson wrote the following notes on 3rd April 1912,
and they are now printed for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>But to get to the cover to which you particularly
directed my attention.&nbsp; It was designed, I take it,
primarily as a decoration, and not as a series of representations
of the characters to appear in the book.&nbsp; Consequently,
there is but little definite character-drawing in any of the
groups with the exception of the one at the bottom of the page,
where Jasper is depicted exactly as I should wish him depicted,
dark and saturnine &lsquo;with thick, lustrous black hair and
whiskers.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the other figure is merely a wraith
conjured up by Jasper&rsquo;s evil opium-soaked conscience, it is
as substantial as one of the ghosts of Hamlet&rsquo;s father
given to us on the stage time after time without protest.&nbsp;
But in a black and white design for a popular <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>serial it is
scarcely possible to be subtle, and at the same time plainly
intelligible.&nbsp; So it may be a ghost, or it may be Edwin in
the flesh, or Neville Landless got up to represent Edwin.&nbsp;
It is a very effective little cut.&nbsp; In the other groups,
Jasper is not so unmistakable, but, of course, in the upper
drawings the sleek, clerical-looking personage with his hand at
his mouth is meant to represent Jasper.&nbsp; The staircase
groups, I can&rsquo;t identify.&nbsp; The young men in both may
be meant to represent Jasper.&nbsp; They are not in the least
like that sombre personage, but just colourless young men.&nbsp;
In the garden scene one cannot think that the kneeling figure
pressing the girl&rsquo;s fingers to his lips is meant for Jasper
at all.&nbsp; It has a mop of fair hair and boasts a moustache,
and in the scene in the garden of the Nuns&rsquo; House Rosa did
not permit Jasper to approach her so nearly.&nbsp; In the picture
there is no suggestion of the repugnance and fear with which she
regarded Jasper.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it reasonable to
suggest that this little picture illustrates a scene to take
place much later in the book, a scene Dickens did not live to
write?&nbsp; It might be Edwin Drood returned from abroad or from
disguise.&nbsp; Edwin Drood making love to Helena Landless.&nbsp;
In chapter viii. he was &lsquo;already enough impressed by Helena
to feel indignant that Helena&rsquo;s brother should dispose of
him (Edwin) so coolly&rsquo; to Rosebud.</p>
<p>Or could it be Tartar proposing to Rosebud?&nbsp; But Tartar
had no moustache either as himself or as Datchery, and the
girl&rsquo;s figure has a suggestion of lithe dignity which I
don&rsquo;t associate with the &lsquo;little beauty&rsquo;
Rosebud.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>I agree
with the author of <i>About Edwin Drood</i> that Edwin was not
worth while bringing back, but it is possible that he was to
return, and that this is he in the garden scene.&nbsp; In the
space above this the female figure scanning a placard
&lsquo;LOST&rsquo; is, I think, merely allegorical, and not meant
to represent Rosebud fleeing from Jasper.&nbsp; In the book she
leaves Cloisterham so neat and pretty that Joe, the omnibus man,
would have liked to keep for himself the love she sent to Miss
Twinkleton.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MR. CUMING WALTERS&rsquo;S READING</h4>
<p>There is another view to which I strongly incline, first
stated by Mr. Cuming Walters.&nbsp; I take the erect figure in
the bottom vignette to be Datchery.&nbsp; It is not Edwin.&nbsp;
The large hat and the tightish surtout are the articles of
clothing on which Dickens lays stress in his description of
Datchery.&nbsp; Mr. Lang says that the figure is that of a young
man in a longish loose greatcoat, not a tightish surtout such as
Datchery wore, but I agree with Mr. Cuming Walters that the
figure corresponds with the description of Datchery.&nbsp; Edwin
as seen above with Rosa in the cathedral is not wearing a coat of
this sort.&nbsp; His hat also is different.&nbsp; On examining
the figure Mr. H. B. Irving said to me: &lsquo;That looks
uncommonly like a woman in disguise.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>None of
us has a right to dogmatise, but the variety of opinions among
those who have studied the cover shows that no certain conclusion
can be drawn from the illustrations.&nbsp; The arguments advanced
previously tend to make this practically certain.&nbsp; In the
discussion of the problem a wholly disproportionate weight has
been laid on the illustrated cover.&nbsp; It would hardly bear
that weight even if every one were agreed as to the reading of
the pictures, and there is no such agreement.</p>

82</span>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE METHODS OF DICKENS</h3>
<h4>HALF-WAY IN DICKENS</h4>
<p>Dickens has left us one-half of his last story.&nbsp; It was
to be completed in twelve parts, and six parts were
published.&nbsp; We can only infer and guess at the way in which
the author would have completed it.&nbsp; Would he have brought
many new characters on the stage, or are we to believe that the
main characters are already there, and that it is through the
revealing of their secrets that the end is to be reached?&nbsp;
To give a positive reply is impossible, and yet we may learn
something of Dickens&rsquo;s methods by studying his complete
books.&nbsp; Supposing we had only one-half of each book in our
possession, might we expect that the complete story would
introduce us to many fresh characters?&nbsp; I give the results
of some investigations from the later novels.</p>
<h4><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>THE
LENGTH OF DICKENS&rsquo;S NOVELS</h4>
<p><i>Edwin Drood</i>, as we have it, runs in round numbers to
about 100,000 words.&nbsp; When completed it would have been
200,000 words.&nbsp; This would have made it slightly longer than
<i>Great Expectations</i>, which may be estimated at 160,000
words.&nbsp; <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> runs to 143,000
words.&nbsp; <i>Edwin Drood</i>, while slightly longer than this,
would have been very much shorter than the larger works of
Dickens.&nbsp; <i>David Copperfield</i> has about 306,000 words;
<i>Bleak House</i>, 308,000, and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>,
297,000.&nbsp; All these are practically the same length.&nbsp;
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i> has about 264,000 words.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;BLEAK HOUSE&rsquo;</h4>
<p>I begin with <i>Bleak House</i>, which is one of the latest
and most elaborate of Dickens&rsquo;s stories.&nbsp; In the first
half the characters arrive in crowds.&nbsp; I make out in the
first chapter ten or eleven.&nbsp; The second chapter brings My
Lady Dedlock, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Mr. Tulkinghorn, and
others.&nbsp; The third brings Esther Summerson and John
Jarndyce, besides half a dozen more.&nbsp; The fourth brings us
the Jellybys, with Mr. Guppy, and others.&nbsp; Krook and Nemo
are the <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>fresh arrivals in chapter v.; Mr. Harold Skim-pole
arrives in chapter vi., with the Coavinses.&nbsp; In chapter vii.
I make out six arrivals at least.&nbsp; Chapter viii. gives us
the Pardiggles, Mr. Gusher, the brickmaker, and family, and
Jenny, his wife.&nbsp; In chapter ix. Mr. Lawrence Boythorn
arrives alone; chapter x. gives us the Snagsbys, their
predecessor, Peffer, the two prentices, and Guster, the
servant.&nbsp; Miss Flite comes with chapter xi., and along with
her appear the young surgeon, the beadle, Mrs. Perkins, Mrs.
Anastasia Piper, and a few more.&nbsp; Chapter xii. brings Mlle.
Hortense, maid to Lady Dedlock, Lord Boodle and his retinue, the
Right Hon. William Buffy, M.P., and his retinue.&nbsp; In Chapter
xiii. we have Mr. Bayham Badger, Mrs. Badger, and the former
husbands of Mrs. Badger are recalled.&nbsp; Chapter xiv. brings
Mr. Turveydrop and his son, also Allan Woodcourt, the young
surgeon, and we have mentioned the &lsquo;old lady with a
censorious countenance,&rsquo; and the late Mrs.
Turveydrop.&nbsp; In chapter xv. we have Mrs. Blinder and the
Neckett family; chapter xvii., Mrs. Woodcourt, mother of Allan;
chapter xix., Mr. and Mrs. Chadband; chapter xx., Young Smallweed
and Jobling, <i>alias</i> Weevle; in chapter xxi., the <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Grandfather
and Grandmother Smallweed, Judith Smallweed, Mr. George, trooper
(Uncle George, chapter vii.), and Phil Squod of the Shooting
Gallery.&nbsp; The great Mr. Bucket appears in chapter
xxii.&nbsp; Captain Hawdon is in chapter xxvi.&nbsp; In chapter
xxvii. we have the Bagnet family of five.&nbsp; In chapter
xxviii. there comes Volumnia Dedlock; Miss Wisk in chapter xxx.,
and Liz in chapter <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>.</p>
<p>We have now reached the end of the first half, and the
arrivals after that are few and unimportant.&nbsp; In chapter
xxxii. no new character is brought on the stage, though there is
talk about the noted siren, who assists at the Harmonic Meetings,
and is announced as Miss M. Melvilleson, though she has been
married a year and a half.&nbsp; In chapter xxxiii. it is
mentioned that the &lsquo;Sols Arms,&rsquo; a well-conducted
tavern, is licensed to a highly respectable landlord, Mr. J. G.
Bogsby.&nbsp; After that we have no new character till chapter
xxxvii., where we are introduced to Mr. W. Grubble, the landlord
of that very clean little tavern, &lsquo;The Dedlock
Arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vholes is introduced by Skimpole as the man
who gives him something and called it commission.&nbsp; Mr.
Vholes has the privilege of supporting an aged father in the Vale
of Taunton, <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>and has a red eruption here and there upon his
face.&nbsp; He has three daughters&mdash;Emma, Jane, and
Caroline&mdash;and cannot afford to be selfish.&nbsp; In chapter
xxxviii. we meet Mrs. Guppy, &lsquo;an old lady in a large cap,
with rather a red nose, and rather an unsteady eye, but smiling
all over.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then in chapter xl. there are the cousins
of Sir Leicester Dedlock.&nbsp; In chapter xliii. Mrs. Skimpole
and the Skimpole family are introduced, and in chapter liii. Mrs.
Bucket.&nbsp; It will be observed that some of these can scarcely
be called new characters, and that not one is of any real
importance, that is, so far as <i>Bleak House</i> is
concerned.&nbsp; Dickens in the middle of his story had
practically put every actor upon the stage.&nbsp; The story was
to be developed by the characters to whom the reader had been
introduced.&nbsp; I have calculated that in the first half there
are about one hundred and six characters of greater or less
importance.&nbsp; In the second half there are, on the most
generous computation, only sixteen, and not one of them plays a
vital part in the development of the tale.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;OUR MUTUAL FRIEND&rsquo;</h4>
<p>I take next <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, and with this I must
deal more briefly.&nbsp; <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>is remarkable
for the profusion of characters in the first half.&nbsp; In the
second chapter there are sixteen at least, including Mr. and Mrs.
Veneering, Mr. and Mrs. Podsnap, Mortimer Lightfoot, Eugene
Wrayburn, and John Harmon.&nbsp; The Wilfers come in chapter iv.;
in chapter v. Silas Wegg and the Boffins, and almost every
chapter adds to the company till we get to the middle.&nbsp;
After that there is an abrupt cessation.&nbsp; There are not more
than half a dozen new characters named in the second part, and
all of them are wholly insignificant, the Deputy Lock, Gruff and
Glum, the Greenwich pensioner, the Archbishop of Greenwich, a
waiter, Mrs. Sprodgkin, the exacting member of the fold, and the
contractor of 500,000 power.&nbsp; In <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>
every character of any significance has been introduced when the
first half ends.&nbsp; The few stragglers who come later have
practically no effect on the story.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;LITTLE DORRIT&rsquo;</h4>
<p>In <i>Little Dorrit</i> we have the old profuseness of
characters; in the first half nearly one hundred, and in the
second half there are practically no new characters at all.&nbsp;
Mr. Tinkler, the valet to Mr. Dorrit, and Mr. Eustace, the <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>classical
tourist, can hardly be counted.&nbsp; In chapter xxi., &lsquo;The
History of a Self-Tormentor,&rsquo; we have Charlotte Dawes, the
false friend, who vanishes instantly, and counts for
nothing.&nbsp; Thus, I think, we may say, taking the three long
books of Dickens&rsquo;s later period, that in each it was his
manner to introduce no new characters of the least import in the
second half of his books.&nbsp; But it may be worth while to
glance at his practice in the shorter tales, <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;A TALE OF TWO CITIES&rsquo;</h4>
<p>In the second half of this fine book there are practically no
new characters that I can trace.&nbsp; The epithet can hardly be
applied to the President of the trial at the Conciergerie.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;GREAT EXPECTATIONS&rsquo;</h4>
<p>It is now agreed that one of Dickens&rsquo;s most perfect
books is <i>Great Expectations</i>.&nbsp; It is known also that
Dickens complied with a suggestion of Lord Lytton&rsquo;s, which
modified the plot&mdash;not seriously nor disagreeably.&nbsp;
Here again in the second part we have very few fresh
characters.&nbsp; We have the Colonel in Newgate introduced to
Mr. Wemmick, but he is &lsquo;sure <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>to be assassinated on
Monday.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let us not forget Miss Skiffins, a good sort
of fellow, with a high regard both for Wemmick and the
Aged.&nbsp; There is the retrospective Provis, but the characters
introduced belong to the past.&nbsp; Finally, in chapter xlvi.,
we have a pleasant glimpse of the Barley family and of Mrs.
Whymple, the best of housewives, and the motherly friend of Clara
and Herbert.&nbsp; It is she who fosters and regulates with equal
kindness and discretion their mutual love.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be
confided to Old Barley, by reason of his being totally unequal to
the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout,
Rum, and Purser&rsquo;s Stores.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These are all the books of which I have made a close personal
examination.&nbsp; I believe that the general result will be the
same in all save two or three exceptional works, such as
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i>.&nbsp; Whether he consciously acted on the
principle that no new characters should be introduced after half
the story was told, it is impossible to say.&nbsp; It seems
certain, however, that he acted upon it.</p>
<h4><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>WILKIE
COLLINS &lsquo;AHEAD OF ALL THE FIELD&rsquo;</h4>
<p>Dickens was no great reader, and it is plain by what he did
not say, as well as by what he did say, that he did not on the
whole admire ardently the work of his contemporaries.&nbsp; But
he made a special exception in the case of Wilkie Collins, with
whom he collaborated on more than one occasion, as in the story
<i>No Thoroughfare</i>.&nbsp; He published in his own magazine
some of Collins&rsquo;s best detective stories, including <i>The
Woman in White</i>, <i>No Name</i>, and <i>The
Moonstone</i>.&nbsp; Of these stories Dickens put first <i>No
Name</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Moonstone</i> he criticised in one of his
letters to Wills.&nbsp; At first he thought it in many respects
&lsquo;much better than anything he has done,&rsquo; but
afterwards he wrote, 26th July 1868: &lsquo;I quite agree with
you about <i>The Moonstone</i>.&nbsp; The construction is
wearisome beyond endurance, and there is a vein of obstinate
conceit in it that makes enemies of readers.&rsquo; <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a></p>
<p>In September 1862 he wrote in enthusiastic terms of admiration
about <i>No Name</i>.&nbsp; This I take to be a very weighty and
significant letter, as will appear in the sequel:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>I have gone through the second volume [<i>No Name</i>]
at a sitting, and I find it <i>wonderfully fine</i>.&nbsp; It
goes on with an ever-rising power and force in it that fills me
with admiration.&nbsp; It is as far before and beyond <i>The
Woman in White</i> as that was beyond the wretched common level
of fiction-writing.&nbsp; There are some touches in the Captain
which no one but a born (and cultivated) writer could get
near&mdash;could draw within hail of.&nbsp; And the originality
of Mrs. Wragge, without compromise of her probability, involves a
really great achievement.&nbsp; But they are all admirable; Mr.
Noel Vanstone and the housekeeper, both in their way as
meritorious as the rest; Magdalen wrought out with truth, energy,
sentiment, and passion, of the very first water.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you with what a strange dash of pride as well as
pleasure I read the great results of your hard work.&nbsp;
Because, as you know, I was certain from the Basil days that you
were the Writer who would come ahead of all the Field&mdash;being
the only one who combined invention and power, both humorous and
pathetic, with that invincible determination to work, and that
profound conviction that nothing of worth is to be done without
work, of which triflers and feigners have no conception. <a
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Swinburne in his study of Wilkie Collins writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is apparently the general opinion&mdash;an
opinion which seems to me incontestable&mdash;that no third book
of their author&rsquo;s can be ranked as equal with <i>The </i><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span><i>Woman in
White</i> and <i>The Moonstone</i>: two works of not more
indisputable than incomparable ability.&nbsp; <i>No Name</i> is
an only less excellent example of as curious and original a
talent. <a name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a"
class="citation">[92a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was not the opinion of Dickens.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;A BACKWARD LIGHT&rsquo;</h4>
<p>On 6th October 1859 Dickens replied to a suggestion by Collins
on the working out of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>.&nbsp; The
italics are mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not positively say that the point you put
might not have been done in your manner; but I have a very strong
conviction that it would have been overdone in that
manner&mdash;too elaborately trapped, baited, and
prepared&mdash;in the main anticipated, and its interest
wasted.&nbsp; This is quite apart from the peculiarity of the
Doctor&rsquo;s [Dr. Manette&mdash;<i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>]
character, as affected by his imprisonment; which of itself
would, to my thinking, render it quite out of the question to put
the reader inside of him before the proper time, in respect of
matters that were dim to himself through being, in a diseased
way, morbidly shunned by him.&nbsp; <i>I think the business of
art is to lay all that ground carefully</i>, <i>not with the care
that conceals itself&mdash;to show</i>, <i>by a backward
light</i>, <i>what everything has been working
to</i>,&mdash;<i>but only to suggest</i>, <i>until the fulfilment
comes</i>.&nbsp; <i>These are the ways of Providence</i>, <i>of
which ways all art is but a little imitation</i>. <a

class="citation">[92b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>EDGAR
ALLAN POE AND DICKENS: A MYSTIFICATION</h4>
<p>Could Dickens keep his secrets well?&nbsp; In other words,
could he prevent his readers from fathoming a mystery till the
proper moment of the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>?&nbsp; An important
help to the answering of this question will be found in the essay
on Charles Dickens by Edgar Allan Poe, who was a critic of
extraordinary penetration.&nbsp; If any one could detect a secret
it was he.&nbsp; But he was also much given to mystification, and
it is not wise to accept anything he says without verifying
it.&nbsp; The essay on Dickens turns largely on <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, and, to the best of my belief, it has not been
strictly examined.</p>
<h5>POE&rsquo;S CLAIM</h5>
<p>Poe says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not prepared to say, so positively as we
could wish, whether by the public at large, the whole
<i>mystery</i> of the murder committed by Rudge, with the
identity of the Maypole ruffian with Rudge himself, was fathomed
at any period previous to the period intended, or, if so, whether
at a period so early as materially to interfere with the interest
designed; but we are forced, through sheer modesty, to suppose
this the case; since, by ourselves individually, the secret was
distinctly understood immediately upon the perusal of the story
of Solomon Daisy, which occurs <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>at the seventh page of this volume of
three hundred and twenty-three.&nbsp; In the number of the
Philadelphia <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> for 1st May 1841 (the
tale having then only begun), will be found a prospective notice
of some length, in which we make use of the following words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Barnaby is the son of the murderer may not appear
evident to our readers&mdash;but we will explain.&nbsp; The
person murdered is Mr. Reuben Haredale.&nbsp; He was found
assassinated in his bed-chamber.&nbsp; His steward (Mr. Rudge,
senior) and his gardener (name not mentioned) are missing.&nbsp;
At first both are suspected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some months
afterward&rdquo;&mdash;here we use the words of the
story&mdash;&ldquo;the steward&rsquo;s body, scarcely to be
recognised but by his clothes and the watch and ring he wore, was
found at the bottom of a piece of water in the grounds, with a
deep gash in the breast, where he had been stabbed by a
knife.&nbsp; He was only partly dressed; and all the people
agreed that he had been sitting up reading in his own room, where
there were many traces of blood, and was suddenly fallen upon and
killed, before his master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, be it observed, it is not the author himself who
asserts that the steward&rsquo;s body was found; he has put the
words in the mouth of one of his characters.&nbsp; His design is
to make it appear, in the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, that the
steward, Rudge, first murdered the gardener, then went to his
master&rsquo;s chamber, murdered <i>him</i>, was interrupted by
his (Rudge&rsquo;s) wife, whom he seized and held <i>by the
wrist</i>, to prevent her giving the alarm&mdash;that he then,
after possessing himself of the booty desired, returned to the
gardener&rsquo;s room, exchanged clothes <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>with him, put
upon the corpse his own watch and ring, and secreted it where it
was afterwards discovered at so late a period that the features
could not be identified.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the prediction we have to examine.&nbsp; In the first
place, was such an article published in the Philadelphia
<i>Saturday Evening Post</i> for 1st May 1841?&nbsp; Mr. J. H.
Ingram, the chief authority on Poe in this country, very kindly
informs me that this review has never been reprinted in any
edition of Poe&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Should it not be searched out
and reprinted in full?&nbsp; I should like to see the context of
Poe&rsquo;s extract, and I should like still more to be sure that
the article appeared as he says it did.&nbsp; Mr. Ingram has no
doubt that the article appeared as stated by Poe.&nbsp; Mr. J. H.
Whitty of Richmond, Va., kindly informs me that all the early
files of the <i>Post</i> are inaccessible.</p>
<p>In the second place, Poe affirms that the article appeared in
the Philadelphia paper for 1st May 1841, and that the tale was
only then begun.&nbsp; As for that, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> was
first published as a volume in 1841, after having run as a serial
in the pages of <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> from 13th
February 1841 to 27th November 1841.&nbsp; I have failed to find
the precise <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>date of its first appearance in America.&nbsp; No doubt
it appeared in serial form, and the first instalments on which
Poe bases his assertions should have been printed in America
considerably earlier than 1st May.&nbsp; But the assertion which
chiefly demands scrutiny is very definitely made by Poe.&nbsp; He
says: The secret was <i>distinctly</i> understood
<i>immediately</i> upon the perusal of the story of Solomon
Daisy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The italics are mine.</p>
<h4>THE STORY OF SOLOMON DAISY</h4>
<p>We turn to the story of Solomon Daisy &lsquo;as told in the
<i>Maypole</i> at any time for four and twenty
years.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is very simple and matter-of-fact.&nbsp;
It tells how Mr. Reuben Haredale, of The Warren, a widower with
one child, left the place when his lady died.&nbsp; He went up to
London, where he stopped some months, but, finding that place as
lonely as The Warren, he suddenly came back with his little girl,
bringing with him besides, that day, only two women servants, and
his steward and a gardener.&nbsp; The rest stayed behind in
London, and were to follow next day.&nbsp; That night, an old
gentleman who lived at Chigwell Row, and had long been poorly,
died, and an order came to Solomon at <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>half after twelve o&rsquo;clock at
night to go and toll the passing bell.&nbsp; Solomon relates to a
thrilled audience how he went out in a windy, rainy, very dark
night; how he entered the church, trimmed the candle, thought of
old tales about dead people rising and sitting at the head of
their own graves, fancying that he saw the old gentleman who was
just dead, wrapping his shroud round him, and shivering as if he
felt it cold.&nbsp; At length he started up and took the bell
rope in his hands.&nbsp; At that minute there rang&mdash;not that
bell, for he had scarcely touched the rope&mdash;but
another!&nbsp; It was only for an instant, and even then the wind
carried the sound away, but he heard it.&nbsp; He listened for a
long time, but it rang no more.&nbsp; He then tolled his own bell
and ran home to bed as fast as he could touch the ground.&nbsp;
Next morning came the news that Mr. Reuben Haredale was found
murdered in his bed-chamber, and in his hand was a piece of the
cord attached to an alarm bell outside, which hung in his room,
and had been cut asunder, no doubt by the murderer when he seized
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was the bell I heard.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
further relates how the steward and the gardener were both
missing, both suspected, but never found.&nbsp; The body <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of Mr. Rudge,
the steward&mdash;scarcely to be recognised by his clothes and
the watch and the ring he wore&mdash;was found months afterwards
at the bottom of a piece of water in the grounds with a deep gash
in the breast where he had been stabbed by a knife.&nbsp; Every
one knew now that the gardener must be the murderer, and Solomon
Daisy predicted that he would be heard of.&nbsp; That is the
whole story as told by Solomon Daisy, and Poe affirms that he
perceived from this story: (1) That the steward Rudge first
murdered the gardener; (2) that he then went to his
master&rsquo;s chamber and murdered him; (3) that he was
interrupted by Rudge&rsquo;s wife, whom he seized and held by the
wrist to prevent her giving the alarm; (4) that he possessed
himself of the booty, returned to the gardener&rsquo;s room,
exchanged clothes with him, put upon the corpse his own watch and
ring, and secreted it where it was afterwards discovered at so
late a period that the features could not be identified.</p>
<h4>WHERE POE FAILED</h4>
<p>Poe admits that his preconceived ideas were not entirely
correct:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gardener was murdered, not before, but after
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>his
master; and that Rudge&rsquo;s wife seized <i>him</i> by the
wrist, instead of his seizing <i>her</i>, has so much the air of
a mistake on the part of Mr. Dickens that we can scarcely speak
of our own version as erroneous.&nbsp; The grasp of a
murderer&rsquo;s bloody hand on the wrist of a woman
<i>enceinte</i> would have been more likely to produce the effect
described (and this every one will allow) than the grasp of the
hand of the woman upon the wrist of the assassin.&nbsp; We may,
therefore, say of our supposition, as Talleyrand said of some
cockney&rsquo;s bad French&mdash;<i>que s&rsquo;il ne soit pas
Fran&ccedil;ais assur&eacute;ment donc il le doit
&ecirc;tre</i>&mdash;that if we did not rightly prophesy, yet, at
least, our prophecy should have been right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no hesitation in saying that this is largely a piece of
pure mystification, another <i>Tale of the Grotesque and
Arabesque</i>.&nbsp; It is conceivable that Poe guesses from
Solomon Daisy&rsquo;s story that the steward Rudge murdered the
gardener and his master.&nbsp; It follows that the steward
changed clothes with the murdered gardener, put upon the corpse
his own watch and ring, and secreted it where it was afterwards
discovered at so late a period that the features could not be
identified.&nbsp; But that Poe should have guessed immediately
after reading Solomon Daisy&rsquo;s story that he seized and held
by the wrist his wife to prevent her giving the alarm is beyond
belief.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the wrist&rsquo; are the three
significant words, and they prove that Poe <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>must have
had before him when writing the parts of the novel up to and
including chapter V.&nbsp; For it is in the fifth chapter that
the first mention is made of the smear of blood on
Barnaby&rsquo;s wrist.&nbsp; We read there:</p>
<blockquote><p>They who knew the Maypole story, and could
remember what the widow was, before her husband&rsquo;s and his
master&rsquo;s murder, understood it well.&nbsp; They recollected
how the change had come, and could call to mind that when her son
was born, upon the very day the deed was known, he bore upon his
wrist what seemed a smear of blood but half washed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Near the beginning of chapter lxii., where Rudge is making his
confession in prison, he says of his wife:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did I see her fall upon the ground; and, when I
stooped to raise her, did she thrust me back with a force that
cast me off as if I had been a child, staining the hand with
which she clasped my wrist?&nbsp; Is <i>that</i> fancy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To claim that the seizing of the wrist could have been deduced
from Solomon Daisy&rsquo;s story by itself is to affirm an
impossibility.</p>
<p>And so vanishes the main value of the prediction.&nbsp; If Poe
wrote that article in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, he wrote
it after having read the fifth chapter of Dickens&rsquo;s
novel.</p>
<h4><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>WHERE POE SUCCEEDED</h4>
<p>It may be asked whether Poe discovered anything from his
reading of the first pages.&nbsp; The only thing which he may
have guessed is the thing which it was comparatively easy to
guess.&nbsp; He may have conjectured that the mysterious stranger
at the Maypole was Rudge Redux.&nbsp; When this surmise had been
lodged in his mind the other deductions follow as a matter of
course from later chapters, as the tale unfolds itself.&nbsp;
Even if Poe identified the stranger at the Maypole with the
murderer it was no great feat, for the murderer is closely
disguised, from which any intelligent reader would infer that he
has a motive for fearing detection in an old haunt.&nbsp; He is
shabbily dressed; he is very curious about the people and events
at The Warren; he is suspected as a criminal of some kind by the
cronies; he strikes Joe as he leaves.&nbsp; On the road he
threatens Varden with murder.&nbsp; This shows us that we have
before us a fugitive criminal.&nbsp; He is presented to us with
all the marks of a villain in hiding.&nbsp; It may be noted that
from Solomon Daisy&rsquo;s story the inference is that only <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>one of two
men committed the murder of Reuben Haredale, the gardener or
Rudge.&nbsp; There has also been a difficulty in identifying the
remains.&nbsp; This leaves Poe no special credit.&nbsp; There is
considerable keenness in his conjecture that the treatment of the
Gordon Riots was an afterthought of Dickens.&nbsp; Poe says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The title of the book, the elaborate and pointed
manner of the commencement, the impressive description of The
Warren, and especially of Mrs. Rudge, go far to show that Mr.
Dickens has really deceived himself&mdash;that the soul of the
plot, as originally conceived, was the murder of Haredale, with
the subsequent discovery of the murderer in Rudge&mdash;but that
this idea was afterwards abandoned, or, rather, suffered to be
merged in that of the Popish riots.&nbsp; The result has been
most unfavourable.&nbsp; That which, of itself, would have proved
highly effective, has been rendered nearly null by its
situation.&nbsp; In the multitudinous outrage and horror of the
Rebellion, the <i>one</i> atrocity is utterly whelmed and
extinguished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But facts, as Poe admits, are against this supposition.&nbsp;
Dickens says in his Preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the object an author has had, in writing a
book, cannot be discovered from its perusal, the probability is
that it is either very deep or very shallow.&nbsp; Hoping that
mine may lie somewhere between these two extremes, I shall say
very little about it, and that <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>only in reference to one
point.&nbsp; No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my
knowledge introduced into any work of fiction, and the subject
presenting very extraordinary and remarkable features, I was led
to project this tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is final.&nbsp; It appears from Forster&rsquo;s biography
that Dickens desired to expose the brutalising character of laws
which led to the incessant execution of men and women
comparatively innocent.&nbsp; It is clear also that Dickens made
a special study of the contemporary newspapers and annual
registers.&nbsp; But Forster admits that the form ultimately
taken by <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> had been comprised only partially
within its first design, and he admits also that the interest
with which the tale begins has ceased to be its interest before
the close.&nbsp; &lsquo;What has chiefly taken the reader&rsquo;s
fancy at the outset almost wholly disappears in the power and
passion with which, in the later chapters, great riots are
described.&nbsp; So admirable is this description, however, that
it would be hard to have to surrender it even for a more perfect
structure of fable.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this I may add that the
letters to the artist Cattermole on the illustrations to
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i> are very valuable for the fullness and
precision of their detail.</p>
<h4><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>DICKENS&rsquo;S WAY</h4>
<p>That it is legitimate to draw inferences from the hints given
by Dickens I should be the last to deny.&nbsp; His purpose was to
provide hints which, when contemplated with what he called a
backward glance, should appear luminous at the end of the
story.&nbsp; Their meaning at the time might be more or less
obscure, but when from the end of the book one could look back
upon its course even to the beginning, he would see that the
artist had a purpose all through, and that he was steadily
preparing his reader for the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.&nbsp; Of
this I give a striking proof, on which, so far as I am aware,
little stress has been laid. <a name="citation104"></a><a
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; The
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> of July 1857 contains an article,
&lsquo;The License of Modern Novelists,&rsquo; in which the
critic deals with <i>Little Dorrit</i>, and denounces his charges
against the administrative system of England.&nbsp; Among other
things, the reviewer says: &lsquo;Even the catastrophe in
<i>Little Dorrit</i> is evidently borrowed from the recent fall
of houses in Tottenham Court Road, which happens to have appeared
in the newspapers at a convenient period.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Dickens,
for the first and only time in his life, so far as I know,
publicly replied to a reviewer.&nbsp; He wrote an article in
<i>Household Words</i> of 1st August 1857, entitled
&lsquo;Curious Misprint in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,&rsquo; in
which he turned upon his critic fiercely and sharply.&nbsp; He
quotes the sentence about the catastrophe in <i>Little
Dorrit</i>, and goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, the Reviewer.&nbsp; The Novelist begs to ask
him whether there is no License in his writing those words, and
stating that assumption as a truth, when any man accustomed to
the critical examination of a book cannot fail, attentively
turning over the pages of <i>Little Dorrit</i>, to observe that
that catastrophe is carefully prepared for from the very first
presentation of the old house in the story; that when Rigaud, the
man who is crushed by the fall of the house, first enters it
(hundreds of pages before the end) he is beset by a mysterious
fear and shuddering; that the rotten and crazy state of the house
is laboriously kept before the reader, whenever the house is
shown; that the way to the demolition of the man and the house
together is paved all through the book with a painful minuteness
and reiterated care of preparation, the necessity of which (in
order that the thread may be kept in the reader&rsquo;s mind
through nearly two years) is one of the adverse incidents of the
serial form of publication?&nbsp; It may be nothing to the
question that Mr. Dickens now publicly declares, on his word of
honour, that that catastrophe was written, was <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>engraved on
steel, was printed, had passed through the hands of compositors,
readers for the press, and pressmen, and was in type and in proof
in the Printing House of Messrs. Bradbury and Evans before the
accident in Tottenham Court Road occurred.&nbsp; But, it is much
to the question that an honourable reviewer might have easily
traced this out in the internal evidence of the book itself,
before he stated, for a fact, what is utterly and entirely, in
every particular and respect, untrue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blows are dealt with a will, and it should be noted that
Dickens is more irritated at the stupidity of the reviewer in
failing to see the way in which he contrived the catastrophe than
at his mistake in the fact.&nbsp; It is to be noted also that
Dickens considered that his serial form of publication compelled
him to be almost too minute, copious, and constant in keeping the
thread in the mind of a reader whose attention had to be
maintained for nearly two years.</p>
<h2><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>PART
II&mdash;ATTEMPT AT A SOLUTION</h2>
<h3><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>CHAPTER V&mdash;WAS EDWIN DROOD MURDERED?</h3>
<p>I reply in the affirmative, and for the following reasons:</p>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; The external testimonies as given in a previous
chapter are all explicit as far as they go in their testimony
that in the intention of Dickens Edwin Drood was murdered.&nbsp;
There is first the testimony of John Forster.&nbsp; To him
Dickens plainly declared that a nephew was to be murdered by his
uncle.&nbsp; The murderer was to discover that his crime was
useless for its purpose, but he was not to be convicted in the
ordinary way.&nbsp; It was by means of a gold ring, which had
resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into which the body
had been cast, that the murderer and the person murdered were to
be identified.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Madame Perugini corroborates Forster&rsquo;s
testimony, and points out that the only thing on which he is not
positive is the ending of Neville <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Landless.&nbsp; He guards himself by
saying, &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; and this makes his testimony to
the more important facts the more impressive.&nbsp; Madame
Perugini, who thoroughly understood the relations between Forster
and Dickens, finds it impossible to believe that Dickens should
have altered his plan without communicating with Forster.&nbsp;
Forster&rsquo;s strong character, and the peculiar friendship
that existed between him and Dickens, make it impossible to
believe that Dickens should suddenly become
&lsquo;underhand,&rsquo; and we might say treacherous, by
inventing a plot which he did not intend to carry into
execution.&nbsp; Forster became a little jealous of
Dickens&rsquo;s confidence, and more than a little exacting in
his demands on it.&nbsp; This Dickens knew, and smiled at
occasionally.&nbsp; But he was very careful not to wound his
friend&rsquo;s very sensitive nature, and he so trusted
Forster&rsquo;s judgment as to be uneasy and unhappy if he did
not obtain its sanction for his decisions and his actions.&nbsp;
If there had been any change of plan Forster would certainly have
been told.&nbsp; He never was told.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Again, we know that Charles Dickens the younger
positively declared that he heard from his father&rsquo;s lips
that Edwin Drood was <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>dead.&nbsp; I have been able to
print part of a play written by Charles Dickens the younger and
Joseph Hatton.&nbsp; This shows beyond contradiction that the
authors believed Drood to be dead.&nbsp; Mr. Hatton says:
&lsquo;Consulting his son, Charles, to whom I offered my sketch,
I found that his father had revealed to him sufficient of the
plot to clearly indicate how the story was to end.&rsquo;&nbsp;
How far this may apply to details we cannot be sure, but most
certainly it certifies the death.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; To this I may add that Madame Perugini&rsquo;s own
firm belief that Drood was dead is of no small importance,
considering that she was the wife of Charles Allston Collins, who
drew the much discussed wrapper.&nbsp; It did not occur either to
Madame Perugini or her husband that there was any doubt as to the
fate of Edwin Drood.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The weighty letter of Sir Luke Fildes printed on
pages 54&ndash;5 confirms unmistakably and strongly the witness
already adduced.&nbsp; Fildes was the sole illustrator of <i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, and he testifies that Collins did not
in the least know the significance of the various groups on the
wrapper.&nbsp; Further, when Sir Luke was puzzled by the
statement <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>that John Jasper was described as wearing a neckerchief
that would go twice round his neck he drew Dickens&rsquo;s
attention to the circumstance that he had previously dressed
Jasper as wearing a little black tie once round the neck, and
asked why the alteration was made.&nbsp; Dickens, a little
disconcerted, suddenly asked, &lsquo;Can you keep a
secret?&rsquo;&nbsp; He then said: &lsquo;I must have the double
necktie!&nbsp; It is necessary, for Jasper strangles Edwin Drood
with it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fildes was impressed by Dickens&rsquo;s
earnestness, and resented the suggestion often made that
Dickens&rsquo;s hints dropped to members of his family or friends
may have been intentionally misleading.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a
little startling,&rsquo; says Sir Luke, &lsquo;after more than
thirty-five years of profound belief in the nobility of character
and sincerity of Charles Dickens, to be told now that he probably
was more or less of a humbug on such occasions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I cannot but feel that the external testimony is too strong to
be explained away, and it ought to be read and pondered in its
entirety.</p>
<h4>II.&nbsp; DICKENS&rsquo;S OWN NOTE</h4>
<p>In the Memoranda made by Dickens for chapter xii., and printed
on page 63, we read <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>that Jasper &lsquo;lays the ground
for the manner of the murder, to come out at last.&nbsp; Night
picture of the Cathedral.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lang himself admits,
&lsquo;It seems almost undeniable that, when Dickens wrote this
note, he meant Jasper to succeed in murdering Edwin.&rsquo; <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<h4>III.&nbsp; THE ADMITTED TESTIMONY OF THE BOOK</h4>
<p>The proof that Edwin Drood was murdered is to my mind mainly
to be found in the pages of the story.&nbsp; One would have to
print a large part of it in order to convey the impressive and
unmistakable force of the whole, but perhaps it is better to read
it as Dickens wrote it.&nbsp; For he himself advances nothing to
modify or mitigate the conclusion that, as the result of a
carefully designed plot, Edwin Drood was foully murdered by his
uncle.&nbsp; Happily it is not necessary to spend much space on
this.&nbsp; I believe that Dr. Jackson is fully justified in his
statement that all who have written on the subject acknowledge
that Jasper tried to murder his nephew, and believed himself to
have succeeded.&nbsp; We all see that Jasper had either strangled
Edwin with a black scarf and committed his body to a heap <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of
quicklime that lay about convenient, or thought that he had done
so.&nbsp; &lsquo;We all see that the crime is to be proved by a
gold ring of rubies and diamonds which Edwin has concealed about
his person, though Jasper does not know it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Proctor writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear that Dickens has intended to convey
the impression that Edwin Drood is murdered, his body and clothes
consumed, Jasper having first taken his watch and chain and
shirt-pin, which cannot have been thrown into the river till the
night of Christmas Day, since the watch, wound up at twenty
minutes past two on Christmas Eve, had run down when found in the
river.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having arrived at this point we may proceed.</p>
<p>Is it conceivable that Jasper, believing himself to have
succeeded in murdering his nephew, could have failed?&nbsp;
Jasper is meant by Dickens to be a man wholly without conscience
and heart.&nbsp; Such characters are not numerous in
Dickens&rsquo;s books, but we have evidence that he knew them and
had pondered over them.&nbsp; I may quote his words in <i>Hunted
Down</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no greater mistake than to suppose that a
man who is a calculating criminal, is, in any phase of his guilt
otherwise than true to himself, and perfectly consistent with his
whole character.&nbsp; Such a man commits murder, and murder is
the natural <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>culmination of his course; such a man has to outface
murder, and will do it with hardihood and effrontery.&nbsp; It is
a sort of fashion to express surprise that any notorious
criminal, having such crime upon his conscience, can so brave it
out.&nbsp; Do you think that if he had it on his conscience at
all, or had a conscience to have it upon, he would ever have
committed the crime?&nbsp; Perfectly consistent with himself, as
I believe all such monsters to be, this Slinkton recovered
himself, and showed a defiance that was sufficiently cold and
quiet.&nbsp; He was white, he was haggard, he was changed; but
only as a sharper who had played for a great stake and had been
outwitted and had lost the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Household Words</i> for 14th June 1856, Dickens has an
article on &lsquo;The Demeanour of Murderers.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is
referring to William Bousfield, &lsquo;the greatest villain that
ever stood in the Old Bailey dock.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bousfield&rsquo;s
demeanour was considered exceedingly remarkable because of his
composure under trial.&nbsp; On this Dickens says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can any one, reflecting on the matter for five
minutes, suppose it possible&mdash;we do not say probable, but
possible&mdash;that in the breast of this poisoner there were
surviving, in the days of his trial, any lingering traces of
sensibility, or any wrecked fragment of the quality which we call
sentiment.&nbsp; Can the profoundest or the simplest man alive
believe that in such a heart there could have been left, by that
time, any touch of pity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>The
murder of Edwin Drood had been so long premeditated that Jasper
had done it hundreds and thousands of times in the opium
den.&nbsp; The motive was his fierce and wolfish passion for
Rosa.&nbsp; He loathed his poor nephew as the chief obstacle to
his wishes, and planned out in every detail a murder which would
utterly remove him from the sight of men.</p>
<p>Jasper, then, was an unredeemed villain, but he was anything
than a fool.&nbsp; He drugged Drood; he strangled him; he put his
body in quicklime; he had time to rob the victim of his
jewellery; he maintained a threatening and defiant
attitude.&nbsp; He was not afraid that Drood would return to
convict him of an attempt to murder.&nbsp; He had done his
business.&nbsp; I think it worth while to point out that in
Dickens&rsquo;s view Jasper&rsquo;s malevolence must have been
raised to the highest point of fury on the night of the
murder.&nbsp; For the murder was committed on a night of the
wildest tempest.&nbsp; Trees were almost torn out of the earth,
chimneys toppled into the streets, the hands of the cathedral
clock were torn off, the lead from the roof was stripped away and
blown into the close, and stones were displaced on the summit of
the great <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>tower.&nbsp; In <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> (chapter ii.)
Dickens says:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are times when the elements being in unusual
commotion, those who are bent on daring enterprises, or agitated
by great thoughts, whether of good or evil, feel a mysterious
sympathy with the tumult of nature, and are roused into
corresponding violence.&nbsp; In the midst of thunder, lightning,
and storm, many tremendous deeds have been committed; men,
self-possessed before, have given a sudden loose to passions they
could no longer control.&nbsp; The demons of wrath and despair
have striven to emulate those who ride the whirlwind and direct
the storm; and man, lashed into madness with the roaring winds
and boiling waters, has become for the time as wild and merciless
as the elements themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>IV.&nbsp; THE RING</h4>
<p>As we have seen, Dickens&rsquo;s method is to make every hint
significant, and, as a rule, not too significant.&nbsp; The
reader at the time may fail to perceive why a particular point is
mentioned, but it is not mentioned carelessly or without
design.&nbsp; The backward glance from the end is to interpret
all.&nbsp; Besides this there are hints in the novels to which he
calls special attention, and which he thereby binds himself to
redeem.&nbsp; Conspicuous among these in <i>Edwin Drood</i> is
the sentence about the jewelled ring <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>and betrothal over which Edwin
Drood&rsquo;s right hand closed as it rested in its little
case.&nbsp; He would not let Rosa&rsquo;s heart be grieved by
those sorrowful jewels.&nbsp; He would restore them to the
cabinet from which he had unwillingly taken them, and keep
silence.&nbsp; He would let them be.&nbsp; He would let them lie
unspoken of in his breast.&nbsp; But Dickens says: &lsquo;Among
the mighty store of wonderful chains that are for ever forging,
day and night, in the vast ironworks of time and circumstance,
there was one chain forged in the moment of that small
conclusion, riveted to the foundations of heaven and earth, and
gifted with invincible force to hold and drag.&rsquo;&nbsp; No
answer to our question, no solution of the problem can be
satisfactory which fails to assign its due weight to this
sentence.&nbsp; In Proctor&rsquo;s first attempt at the solution
of <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> contained in <i>Leisure
Readings</i>, we find the following amazingly inept words:
&lsquo;From the stress laid on this point, and the clear words in
which its association with the mystery is spoken of, we may
safely infer, I think, that it is intended partly to mislead the
reader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later on, Proctor, seeing the insufficiency of this,
propounded another theory.&nbsp; This was <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>that the
attempt on Drood and his rescue were known almost immediately to
Mr. Grewgious, who took possession of the ring; that when the
fact that such a ring had been in Drood&rsquo;s pocket came to
Jasper&rsquo;s knowledge he at once in a state of panic rushed to
the vault to recover it from among the quicklime; that Drood,
divining this intention, concealed himself in the vault and
confronted Jasper the moment he opened the door.&nbsp; This
theory is partly approved of by Mr. William Archer. <a
name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a>&nbsp; But Dickens&rsquo;s point is
plainly that the ring was the only jewellery possessed by Drood
about which Jasper knew nothing.&nbsp; It is the finding of the
ring in the tomb that is to bring the guilt of the murder
home.</p>
<p>As for the numerous assumptions made by Proctor, it can only
be said that they have no foundation in the facts.&nbsp; There is
no reason to believe that the attempt on Drood and his rescue
were known almost immediately to Mr. Grewgious.&nbsp; There is no
evidence that Grewgious took possession of the ring.&nbsp; There
is no evidence that Jasper came to know that such had been in
Drood&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; All these theories are not only
without foundation, but, I think, <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>also in plain contradiction to the
whole tenor of the story.</p>
<p>If Drood was half dead how did he get away?&nbsp; According to
Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s ingenious theory he was rescued from the bed
of quicklime by Durdles.&nbsp; He was rescued with the skin burnt
off his face, and his eyebrows gone, so that he could afterwards
disguise himself as Datchery.&nbsp; If this is so, the quicklime
must have behaved itself in a singularly obliging and
accommodating manner.&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, there is no
evidence whatever for the theory, and the whole drift of the
story makes against it.&nbsp; The difficulties are admitted even
by those who incline to support Proctor&rsquo;s view and to
maintain that Edwin is not dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang admits that Proctor&rsquo;s theory of the murder is
thin, and that &lsquo;all this set of conjectures is crude to the
last degree.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am content to leave it at that.&nbsp;
Mr. Lang has conjectures of his own.&nbsp; He conjectures that
Mr. Grewgious visited the tomb of his lost love, Rosa&rsquo;s
mother, and consecrated to her &lsquo;a night of memories and
sighs.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says: &lsquo;Mrs. Bud, his lost love, we
have been told, was buried hard by the Sapsea
monument.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is not told by Dickens.&nbsp; It is
better to stick by the narrative.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Supposing that Edwin was not dead, what was the meaning
of the long silence?&nbsp; Why did he allow Neville to rest under
a cloud of suspicion, and exposed to great peril?&nbsp; Why did
he allow Jasper&rsquo;s persecution of Rosa?&nbsp; Why did he
allow Helena Landless, whom he had begun more or less to love, to
suffer with the rest?&nbsp; Are we to suppose that he came back
disguised to fix the guilt on his uncle?&nbsp; Can we believe
that he did not know that his uncle had tried to murder
him?&nbsp; If not, are we to believe that he suspected his uncle
and was not sure, and came down to try to surprise his
uncle&rsquo;s secret and to punish him?&nbsp; He could only have
punished him at most for an attempt at murder.&nbsp; Even that
might have been hard to bring home, supposing he himself was not
clear as to the facts.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fancy can suggest no
reason,&rsquo; writes Mr. Lang, &lsquo;why Edwin Drood, if he
escaped from his wicked uncle, should go spying about instead of
coming openly forward.&nbsp; No plausible, unfantastic reason
could be invented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. M. R. James, one of the few who still think that Edwin
might not have been murdered, says in his last writing on the
subject: &lsquo;I freely confess that the view that Edwin is <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>dead solves
many difficulties.&nbsp; A wholly satisfactory theory of the
manner of his escape has never been devised; his failure to clear
Neville from suspicion is hard to explain.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lang,
in what has unhappily proved his last article on the subject, in
<i>Blackwood</i> for May 1911, explains that while he believed in
1905 that Jasper failed in his attempt to murder, &lsquo;now I
have no theory as to how the novel would have been built
up.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>V.</h4>
<p>Those who more or less strongly still believe that Dickens
meant to spare Edwin rest their case mainly on a subjective
impression.&nbsp; Says Dr. James: &lsquo;On the other hand,
whether the result would be a piece of &ldquo;bad art&rdquo; or
not, I do think it is more in Dickens&rsquo;s manner to spare
Edwin than to kill him.&nbsp; The subjective impression that he
is not doomed is too strong for me to dismiss.&rsquo; <a
name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; It is difficult to argue against
a subjective impression.&nbsp; The fact remains that Edwin Drood
becomes superfluous.&nbsp; He has effected no lodgment in any
human heart.&nbsp; Mr. Walters says that Drood is little more
than a name-label attached to a <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>body, a man who never excites
sympathy, and whose fate causes no emotion.&nbsp; Proctor, who
believes that Edwin Drood survived, admits that he lived
unpaired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rosa was to give her hand to Tartar,
Helena Landless to Crisparkle, while Edwin and Mr. Grewgious were
to look on approvingly, though Edwin a little sadly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lang in the Gadshill edition of Dickens wrote:
&lsquo;Edwin and Neville are quarrelsome cubs, not come to
discretion, and the fatuity of Edwin, though not exaggerated
much, makes him extremely unsympathetic.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in his
book on the subject Mr. Lang changes his view and writes:
&lsquo;On re-reading the novel I find that Dickens makes Drood as
sympathetic as he can.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus impressions alter.&nbsp;
Gillan Vase, in her continuation of the story would make us
believe that on Edwin&rsquo;s reappearance Rosa transferred her
heart from Tartar to her old lover!&nbsp; But taking the story as
it stands, we see that the sorrow for his death is not deep, and
that no heart is broken by his disappearance.&nbsp; Rosa is
consoled, and more than consoled.&nbsp; Helena grieves for her
brother, and flings a shield over Rosa.&nbsp; Neville and Edwin
have never been good friends.&nbsp; Grewgious has <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>cheerfully
acquiesced in, if he has not instigated, the breaking of the
engagement between Rosa and Edwin.&nbsp; The appropriate
explanation is: &lsquo;Poor youth!&nbsp; Poor youth!&rsquo;&nbsp;
That is all.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that there is a parallel between <i>No
Thoroughfare</i> and <i>Edwin Drood</i>.&nbsp; According to
Proctor it is suggested clearly in <i>No Thoroughfare</i> that
Vendale has been murdered beyond all seeming hope.&nbsp;
Proctor&rsquo;s real argument seems to be that Vendale is not
marked for death, and does not die, and that Edwin Drood belongs
to the same class.&nbsp; He says that Nell and Paul, Richard
Carson and the other characters who die in Dickens&rsquo;s
stories are marked for death from the beginning, but that there
is not one note of death in all that Edwin does or says.&nbsp; I
believe that this is entirely contrary to the facts.&nbsp; There
are some who like Edwin, but none who love him.&nbsp; He is hated
by his uncle, and hated perhaps by Neville.</p>
<p>In <i>No Thoroughfare</i>, a story written by Wilkie Collins
and Dickens in 1867 as a Christmas Number, we have the story of a
man supposed dead coming to life again.&nbsp; It may be noted
that the only portions of this story furnished exclusively by
Dickens were the overture and the <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>third act.&nbsp; Collins contributed
to the first and fourth act, and wrote the whole of the
second.&nbsp; Vendale, a wine-merchant, is in love with a Swiss
girl, Marguerite.&nbsp; She returns his affection, but her
guardian Obenreizer is bitterly opposed.&nbsp; He consents,
however, to the marriage if Vendale can double his income and
make it &pound;3000 a year.&nbsp; Vendale discovers that a
forgery has been committed, through which &pound;500 are
missing.&nbsp; He is asked by the Swiss firm with which he deals
to send a trustworthy messenger to investigate the fraud and
discover its perpetrator.&nbsp; Vendale resolves to go himself,
and tells Obenreizer.&nbsp; Obenreizer is the culprit, though
Vendale does not suspect it, and the two go to Switzerland
together.&nbsp; Obenreizer keeps planning a murder, and contrives
to give Vendale an opium draught.&nbsp; He drugs him again, and
in the course of a perilous mountain journey Vendale is roused to
the knowledge that Obenreizer had set upon him, and that they
were struggling desperately in the snow.&nbsp; Vendale rolls
himself over into a gulf.&nbsp; But help is near.&nbsp;
Marguerite&rsquo;s fears have been excited, and she has followed
her lover on the journey.&nbsp; She engages a rescue expedition,
and they find the lost man insensible.&nbsp; He is delirious and
quite <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>unconscious where he is.&nbsp; Then he seems to sink in
the deadly cold, and his heart no longer beats.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
broke from them all, and sank over him on his litter with both
her living hands upon the heart that stood still.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But by and by, when the crisis of the exposure comes,
&lsquo;supported on Marguerite&rsquo;s arm&mdash;his sunburnt
colour gone, his right arm bandaged and slung over his
breast&mdash;Vendale stood before the murderer a man risen from
the dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; I cannot see that this is a great
surprise.&nbsp; Vendale was not marked for death.&nbsp; I think
the unsophisticated reader, knowing how he is loved and how he is
waited for, and how unconsciousness may pass into consciousness,
would fully expect him to live.&nbsp; When he comes to life, he
is supported on Marguerite&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; There was no arm on
which Edwin Drood could lean.&nbsp; Dickens can provide for his
old bachelors like Newman Noggs, but he had no provision for
Edwin.</p>
<h4>THE ARGUMENTS FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE THEORY</h4>
<p><i>From the Wrapper</i>.&mdash;I am convinced after a careful
perusal of nearly all that has been written on the subject that
the real strength of the disappearance theory is to be found in
the <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>bottom picture of the wrapper.&nbsp; When Madame
Perugini published the article from which I have quoted, Mr. Lang
in a letter to the <i>Times</i> <a name="citation127"></a><a
href="#footnote127" class="citation">[127]</a> rested his whole
case on the cover design.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The chief difficulty in accepting the fact has
always been that, in designs on the covers, by Mr. C. A. Collins,
first husband of Mrs. Perugini, we see a young man, who is
undeniably Edwin Drood, confronting Jasper in a dark vault, in
the full light of a lantern held up by Jasper.&nbsp; Mrs.
Perugini says that this figure may be regarded as &lsquo;the
ghost of Edwin as seen by Jasper in his half-dazed and drugged
condition,&rsquo; or Helena Landless &lsquo;dressed as
Datchery.&rsquo;&nbsp; The figure is not dressed as Datchery, nor
was Miss Landless fair like Drood, but very dark.&nbsp; As for
the ghost, he is as substantial as Jasper, and it is most
improbable that Dickens would have a mere hallucination designed
in such a substantial fashion, &lsquo;massive and
concrete,&rsquo; as Pip said of Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s rendering of
the part of Hamlet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Lang in his final <i>Blackwood</i> paper repeats the
assertion with unhesitating confidence.&nbsp; He goes so far as
to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last, Dickens had instructed his son-in-law,
Charles Collins (brother of Wilkie Collins), to design a
pictorial cover of the numbers, in which Jasper, entering a <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>dark vault
with a lantern, finds a substantial shadow-casting Drood
&lsquo;in his habit as he lived,&rsquo;&mdash;soft conical hat
and all,&mdash;confronting him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to this we note:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That Collins received no such instructions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That neither Collins nor Luke Fildes nor any of the
Dickens family read the illustration in that sense.&nbsp; They
all supposed Edwin to be dead.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We also note that, in spite of Mr. Lang&rsquo;s
confident assertions, there is no unanimity as to the meaning of
the design.&nbsp; It may be Drood; it may be, as I think it is,
Datchery; it may be Neville Landless, as Mr. Hugh Thomson has
suggested.&nbsp; But no one is entitled to dogmatise on the
subject.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As I have already pointed out, in the great majority
of the wrappers the designs are vague and general, and cannot be
verified in the narrative.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But to my mind the most conclusive proof that the
wrapper is not to be rigidly and pedantically interpreted is that
Dickens himself was the very last man in the world to give away
his secrets on the cover.&nbsp; On this Madame Perugini has said
all that needs to be said.&nbsp; I am glad to find that in his
last review of the <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>controversy Dr. M. R. James makes no mention of the
wrapper evidence.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;WHEN SHALL THESE THREE MEET AGAIN?&rsquo;</h4>
<p>It appears that certain readers have taken the heading of
chapter xiv., &lsquo;When shall these three meet again?&rsquo; as
an argument for the theory that Drood reappears.&nbsp; If the use
of the quotation has any special interest a very good
interpretation has been supplied by Mr. Edwin Charles.&nbsp; Mr.
Charles points out that the words are used in <i>Macbeth</i>
before the three witches meet again to plant in Macbeth&rsquo;s
mind the tragical lust of ambition.&nbsp; He slays Duncan, who is
at once his guest, his kinsman, and his king.&nbsp; And
Duncan&rsquo;s sons, also guests of Macbeth, fly respectively to
England and Ireland, and Macbeth uses the flight to spread
suspicion against them.&nbsp; &lsquo;We hear our bloody cousins
are bestow&rsquo;d in England and in Ireland: not confessing
their cruel parricide.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jasper is Edwin Drood&rsquo;s
kinsman and guardian and host.&nbsp; Jasper slays his nephew, and
contrives that the suspicion of his murder shall fall on his
other guest, Neville Landless, who has to leave
Cloisterham.&nbsp; Is this a chance parallel?&nbsp; Does the use
of the words in the heading of the <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>chapter prove that Dickens had the
tragedy of <i>Macbeth</i> in his mind?&nbsp; Mr. Charles not only
thinks so, but he holds that the quotation positively destroys
any shadow of doubt as to what was intended to be the fate of
Edwin.&nbsp; Mr. Charles also notes that Dickens makes another
reference to Macbeth in the story when he records the dinner
which Grewgious gave to Edwin and Bazzard at Staple Inn.&nbsp;
Speaking of the leg of the flying waiter Dickens says that
&lsquo;it always preceded him and the tray by some seconds, and
always lingered after he disappeared,&rsquo; adding, &lsquo;like
Macbeth&rsquo;s leg when accompanying him off the stage with
reluctance to the assassination of Duncan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is not much to reply to in the argument, but the reply
is, to say the least, sufficient.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;EDWIN DROOD IN HIDING&rsquo;</h4>
<p>Another argument has been drawn from the tentative titles
written by Dickens here first printed in full.&nbsp; Two of them
are &lsquo;The Flight of Edwin Drood,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Edwin
Drood in Hiding.&rsquo;&nbsp; On this Mr. Lang writes in the
<i>Morning Post</i> <a name="citation130"></a><a
href="#footnote130" class="citation">[130]</a> that, though the
titles do not go with the idea <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>that Edwin was to be slain early,
Dickens may have intended the titles to mislead his readers, and
may have rejected them because he felt them to be too
misleading.&nbsp; This I believe to be the exact truth.&nbsp;
Dickens was willing to have as much mystery as possible, but he
soon perceived that it would not suit his purpose to raise the
question whether Edwin was dead or alive.</p>
<h4>THE MANNER OF THE MURDER</h4>
<p>In Dr. Jackson&rsquo;s book on the subject there is a very
able discussion on the manner in which the murder was
accomplished.&nbsp; Dr. Jackson inquires: (1) Where and how did
Jasper murder Drood, or attempt to murder him?&nbsp; (2) Where
and how did Jasper dispose of Drood&rsquo;s body, or attempt to
dispose of it?&nbsp; For myself, I believe that the manner of the
murder is part of the mystery to be solved as the book
proceeds.&nbsp; In this I am in general agreement with
Proctor.&nbsp; It would be vain to guess what happened on that
stormy night.&nbsp; To give the details definitely would have
been to give them prematurely, for much of the interest of the
novel is to depend on their unfolding.&nbsp; But certain
suggestions may be offered.&nbsp; Dr. Jackson <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>holds that
significance is to be attached to Jasper&rsquo;s babblings in the
presence of the opium woman.&nbsp; He tells her that he has in
his mind the tower of the cathedral, a perilous journey over
abysses with an indispensable fellow-traveller.&nbsp; Also that
when the journey was really made there was &lsquo;no struggle, no
consciousness of peril, no entreaty,&rsquo; but that &lsquo;a
poor, mean, miserable thing,&rsquo; which was nevertheless real,
lay &lsquo;down below at the bottom.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Jackson
thinks that we have here Jasper&rsquo;s confession of the place
and the manner of the crime.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had ascended the
tower with Edwin, and he had seen Edwin&rsquo;s body lying down
below, presumably at the foot of the staircase by which they had
ascended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Walters thinks that Drood was to be encountered near the
cathedral, drugged and then strangled with the black silk scarf
that Jasper wore round his own neck.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor and Mr.
Lang suppose that Jasper partially strangled Drood near the
cathedral, and then deposited his body in the Sapsea
monument.&nbsp; They do not explain &lsquo;the perilous journey
over abysses.&rsquo;&nbsp; The babblings of the opium den become
intelligible if Jasper flung or pushed Drood down the staircase
of the tower.&nbsp; But if <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Drood was attacked outside the
cathedral on level ground they are &lsquo;unjustifiable
mystifications.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson further argues that in chapter xii., &lsquo;A
Night with Durdles,&rsquo; is a rehearsal of the coming
tragedy.&nbsp; He thinks that when Durdles sleeps Jasper makes a
wax impression of a key with which Durdles had opened the outside
door of the crypt and the door between the crypt and the
cathedral.&nbsp; He finds quicklime in the crypt.&nbsp; Then he
flings or pushes Drood, who is drugged, down the staircase, and
deposits his body in the quicklime in the crypt.&nbsp; Else why
did Jasper make a careful study of the tower with Durdles?</p>
<p>My friend and colleague, Miss Jane T. Stoddart, kindly sends
me the following:</p>
<p class="poetry">Some critics have failed to realise the extreme
importance of the Sapsea monument in connection with the
murder.&nbsp; It has been suggested by Professor Jackson that
Jasper buried the body in a heap of lime in the crypt of the
cathedral.&nbsp; But crypts are semi-public places, and if heaps
of lime were about workmen would be coming and going.&nbsp; In no
case could a corpse lie unnoticed on the open floor of a crypt
for more than a few hours.&nbsp; All the evidence points rather
to the Sapsea monument in the graveyard as the murderer&rsquo;s
chosen hiding-place.&nbsp; Observe how Dickens distinguishes
between tombs and monuments, clearly <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>meaning by the latter those massive
vault-like erections of stone which are often seen in old
churchyards, and which have the dimensions of small chambers with
a corridor.&nbsp; Durdles says in chapter V.: &lsquo;&ldquo;Say
that hammer of mine&rsquo;s a wall&mdash;my work.&nbsp; Two;
four; and two is six,&rdquo; measuring on the pavement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Six foot inside that wall is Mrs. Sapsea.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not really Mrs. Sapsea?&rdquo; asks
Jasper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Say Mrs. Sapsea.&nbsp; Her wall&rsquo;s thicker,
but say Mrs. Sapsea.&nbsp; Durdles taps that wall represented by
that hammer, and says, after good sounding: &lsquo;Something
betwixt us!&rsquo;&nbsp; Sure enough, some rubbish has been left
in that same six-foot space by Durdles&rsquo;s
men!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is therefore a &lsquo;six-foot&rsquo; vacant space at
least in the Sapsea monument, left, no doubt, for the reception
at some far distant date of the Mayor&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Within
this place Jasper decides to deposit the remains of his
victim.&nbsp; I do not agree with the critics who fancy there was
a Sapsea vault in the crypt.&nbsp; The monument is in the full
light of day, for in chapter xii. the Mayor is walking near the
churchyard &lsquo;on the look-out for a blushing and retiring
stranger.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in chapter xviii. he calls
Datchery&rsquo;s attention to this &lsquo;small lion&rsquo; in
the churchyard.&nbsp; Mrs. Sapsea, we are distinctly told, is
buried within the monument, not in any subterranean vault in the
crypt.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE &lsquo;NIGHT WITH
DURDLES&rsquo;</p>
<p>We come now to the night of the mysterious expedition of
Jasper and Durdles, when they climb the Cathedral Tower in the
moonlight, and when Durdles lies in a drugged sleep on the floor
of the crypt.&nbsp; Jasper <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>has been very active during this
interval.&nbsp; How has his time been spent?&nbsp; His first
business, after possessing himself of the key of the crypt, must
have been to search in the bundle carried by Durdles for the key
of the Sapsea monument.&nbsp; We have repeatedly been told of his
interest in the bundle, into which (see chapter iv.) he had seen
Durdles drop this particular key.&nbsp; The inscription had been
placed on the monument, but we are to understand that the key had
not yet been returned to the Mayor.&nbsp; Having secured this
key, Jasper leaves the building, and by some means which can only
be conjectured conveys quicklime to the monument, and places it
in readiness in the empty space.&nbsp; He may have gone back to
the yard-gate where Durdles had showed him the mound of lime, but
this would have been a very risky proceeding, as the &lsquo;hole
in the city wall&rsquo; occupied by Durdles was beyond Minor
Canon Corner, the Monks&rsquo; Vineyard, and the
Travellers&rsquo; Twopenny.&nbsp; Even in the dead of night,
sharp eyes in the lodging-house (Deputy&rsquo;s, for instance)
might have seen a man go by wheeling lime in a barrow or carrying
it in a sack.&nbsp; It is far more probable that the lime was
found nearer to the cathedral.</p>
<p>It has been suggested, further, that Jasper, while away from
Durdles, took a wax model of the key of the crypt, which also
opens the door at the top of the steps leading from the crypt to
the cathedral.&nbsp; The Dean (it is presumed by Professor
Jackson) has already entrusted him with another key, that of the
iron gate which gives access to the Tower.&nbsp; We are told that
Durdles &lsquo;bears the close scrutiny of his companion in an
insensible way, although it is prolonged while <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the latter
fumbles among his pockets for a key confided to him that will
open an iron gate, so to enable him to pass to the staircase of
the great Tower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Visitors to cathedrals to-day usually find that the key of the
tower staircase is in charge of the chief verger, and Jasper
would have no difficulty in obtaining a loan of it from this
functionary for one night, though hardly for a longer period, as
visitors would be coming and going.</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson supposes that the Dean lent his key to the
choirmaster, and assumes that, before the expedition with
Durdles, Jasper has already taken a wax model of it.&nbsp; If he
did so, it must have been in the interval between locking-up
time, when we find him (see chapter xii.) conversing with the
Dean and the verger, and the time of his changing his coat to go
out on the expedition.&nbsp; But Dickens tells us that Mr. Jasper
withdrew to his piano, and sat chanting choir music in a low and
beautiful voice for two or three hours; &lsquo;in short, until it
has been for some time dark, and the moon is about to
rise.&rsquo;&nbsp; I take it, then (1) that the iron key was lent
to Jasper by the verger for use in this nocturnal expedition; (2)
that no wax model of it has been made up to the time of starting;
(3) that the verger will look for the return of the key next
day.</p>
<p>It seems to me most unlikely that Jasper took a wax model of
the crypt key or the key to the iron gate, either on the night of
his wandering with Durdles, or at any other time.&nbsp; If he
took any wax model, it was that of the key to the Sapsea
monument.&nbsp; He used the crypt key merely to let himself out
of the building <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>and in again.&nbsp; May not the simplest explanation be
that he unlocked the door of the monument, leaving it merely
closed, so that a turn of the iron handle would admit him on the
night of the murder?&nbsp; According to the picture at the foot
of the cover the door seems to have a handle.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to believe that Jasper would order
duplicates of two large and unusual-looking keys to be made from
wax models by a locksmith in Cloisterham.&nbsp; Such an order
would have excited curiosity and perhaps unfavourable surmises in
a town where Jasper was so well known.&nbsp; I should expect a
curious stare if I carried wax models of church keys even to a
locksmith in a London suburb; and Jasper had no time during the
week before Christmas to make a journey to London.&nbsp; He was
not himself a worker in iron like Roland Graeme in <i>The
Abbot</i>, who at the cost of much time and labour forged a bunch
of keys almost exactly resembling those carried by the lady of
Lochleven.</p>
<p>On the night of the murder&mdash;that wild and stormy
Christmas Eve&mdash;Jasper brought Edwin into the churchyard on
some pretext, after partially stupefying him with the &lsquo;good
stuff&rsquo; which affects the brain so speedily.&nbsp; He may
have persuaded him to drink to the dawn of Christmas, as Faust
proposed to quaff the cup of poison to the rising Easter
dawn:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Der letzte Trunk sei nun,
mit ganzer Seele,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Als festlich hoher Gruss, dem
Morgen zugebracht.</p>
<p>It is after midnight when the murderer and his victim are
abroad together.&nbsp; At that hour the &lsquo;streets <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>are
empty,&rsquo; and only the storm goes thundering along
them.&nbsp; The precincts &lsquo;are unusually dark
to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; No need, then, for Jasper to fear
detection as he slips the great silk scarf over Edwin&rsquo;s
head and pulls it tightly round his throat.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
struggle, no consciousness of peril, no entreaty&mdash;and yet I
never saw that before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The maundering talk of Jasper in the opium woman&rsquo;s den
need not be taken literally.&nbsp; The difficult and dangerous
journey &lsquo;over abysses where a slip would be
destruction&rsquo; may have no reference to the actual tower, but
to the perils of the scheme and the risk of detection.&nbsp;
Among other modes of killing, however, the idea of flinging Edwin
from the tower may have occurred to Jasper, and been
abandoned.&nbsp; Hence his outcry, &lsquo;Look down! look
down!&nbsp; You see what lies at the bottom there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson thinks Jasper departed so far from his original
plan that he chose the crypt instead of the Sapsea monument as a
hiding-place.&nbsp; I think it far more likely that, if ever he
intended to hurl Edwin from the tower, he set aside this plan
when he found that it meant the making of two duplicate
keys.&nbsp; Suppose that in the days following the crime, when
the names of Edwin Drood and Jasper were in every mouth in
Cloisterham, a small tradesman in some obscure lane were to ask
his neighbours why the choirmaster needed these two large
keys.&nbsp; The conjecture might be sufficient to destroy
him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I venture to think that Miss Stoddart is right in assigning
the place of the body to the Sapsea <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>monument, but I incline to agree
with Dr. Jackson that, in order to do justice to the &lsquo;Night
with Durdles,&rsquo; and the confessions to the opium woman, we
must give some place to the tower as connected with the
murder.&nbsp; But I do not understand how Jasper should have seen
Drood lying beneath him dead if he had merely pushed him down the
tower stairs.&nbsp; Would it not have been more likely that
Jasper should have pushed Drood from the galleries, and seen him
fall into the space beneath?&nbsp; We cannot lay great stress on
the topography of Cloisterham.&nbsp; The Sapsea monument is a
pure invention, having no counterpart in Rochester, and Dickens
manifestly used the utmost freedom in dealing with his
materials.&nbsp; Mr. Lang, by the way, makes a strange mistake in
saying, &lsquo;As he walks with Durdles that worthy explains (in
reply to a question by Jasper) that, by tapping a wall, even if
over six feet thick, with his hammer, he can detect the nature of
the contents of the vault.&rsquo; <a name="citation139"></a><a

not six feet thick.&nbsp; The words are: &lsquo;six foot inside
that wall is Mrs. Sapsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was for Dickens to explain in the remaining part of the
novel how the murder was achieved, and no one has a right to say
that he would <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>have failed in doing so.&nbsp; His object is to leave
upon us the impression of a murder which was in a singular degree
premeditated, ferocious, and complete.&nbsp; If Dr. Jackson is
right in supposing that Drood was thrown from the tower, in
addition to his being drugged, strangled, and laid in quicklime,
Dickens gives us a fresh thrill of horror.</p>
<h3><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>CHAPTER VI&mdash;WHO WAS DATCHERY?</h3>
<p>In discussing this problem we have no aid from external
evidence.&nbsp; It seems that the question was not raised by the
critics of the time.&nbsp; We are thrown upon internal evidence,
and not only the internal evidence of the book, but the evidence
given by a study of Dickens&rsquo;s methods.&nbsp; We have also,
as I hope to show, some help given indirectly from
Dickens&rsquo;s own biography, and in particular from a book by
Wilkie Collins.</p>
<p>It will be convenient at this stage that we should discuss the
exact position of affairs after Edwin vanished from the
scene.</p>
<p>To us who read the book, Jasper&rsquo;s guilt is so plain and
his character so atrocious that we wonder why those who knew him
did not at once suspect his guilt.&nbsp; To us Jasper is a
self-confessed criminal with his doom already written, but to his
neighbours at Cloisterham he presented himself in a wholly
different <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>aspect.&nbsp; The Dean himself is not more obviously a
pattern of virtuous living.&nbsp; Jasper occupies a conspicuous
set of rooms.&nbsp; His fire burns, his red light glimmers, his
curtains are drawn, in sight of all the town.&nbsp; He is young,
good-looking, socially attractive, and occupied in an almost
sacred profession.&nbsp; His duties as choirmaster raise him far
above the position of a provincial teacher of music.&nbsp; On
Sundays and weekdays the people hear his voice in Psalms and
Canticles and Anthems.&nbsp; Edwin expresses the truth about his
uncle&rsquo;s standing when he says: &lsquo;I should have put in
the foreground your being so much respected as Lay Precentor, or
Lay Clerk, or whatever you call it, of this Cathedral; your
enjoying the reputation of having done such wonders with the
choir; your choosing your society, and holding such an
independent position in this queer old place.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Crisparkle remarks on his &lsquo;well-bred consideration,&rsquo;
and his pallor as of &lsquo;gentlemanly ashes.&rsquo;&nbsp; When
the story opens there is not a soul in Cloisterham who breathes a
word of scandal against him, and his real nature is suspected by
only two living persons known to us.&nbsp; One is Rosa Bud, whom
he has terrified by his secret love-making; the other the <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>opium woman
in London, who has heard strange mutterings in his drugged sleep
which to her were not wholly &lsquo;unintelligible.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Dean&rsquo;s fear is that &lsquo;Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s heart may
be too much set on his nephew.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nocturnal ramblings
with the disreputable Durdles suggest nothing more surprising to
the Dean than that Jasper means to write a book about the
place.&nbsp; His visits to London are so carefully timed that he
is rarely absent from the daily services.&nbsp; He is a favourite
with his landlady, Mrs. Tope, and to mothers with marriageable
daughters he must appear a very eligible young bachelor.&nbsp;
Who could dream that a man of twenty-six, refined, highly
educated, and agreeable, should seek his private recreation in an
opium den?</p>
<p>Eight or nine months pass away, and at the point where the
story closes Jasper is to all appearance still safe and
prosperous.&nbsp; But already the avengers are upon his track,
and we shall find it possible from the indications given in the
book to show that there were at least six persons designed to
have a share in the final capture.</p>
<p>The first mind in which suspicion lodges is clearly that of
Mr. Grewgious, and he has taken his impressions of Jasper from
Rosa and from <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Helena Landless.&nbsp; From his interview with Rosa in
chapter ix. he learned that the young bride-elect wished to have
nothing to do with Jasper.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like Mr.
Jasper to come between us,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in any
way.&rsquo;&nbsp; After the murder, when Grewgious comes to
Jasper&rsquo;s rooms he has already seen Rosa and Helena
Landless, and the latter must have told him of the persecution to
which Rosa has been subjected.&nbsp; When Jasper utters a
terrible shriek and falls to the ground in a swoon, his companion
stands by the fire, warming his hands, and looking curiously at
the prostrate figure.&nbsp; He refuses to eat with Jasper, and
treats him from that time onwards as &lsquo;a brigand and wild
beast in combination.&rsquo;&nbsp; He keeps a personal watch on
his movements in Staple Inn, and it is doubtless with his
connivance and support that Datchery goes to Cloisterham.&nbsp;
Are not these significant words of Grewgious in chapter xxi. to
Rosa and Crisparkle: &lsquo;When one is in a difficulty, or at a
loss, one never knows in what direction a way out may chance to
open.&nbsp; It is a business principle of mine, in such a case,
not to close up any direction, but to keep an eye on every
direction that may present itself.&nbsp; I could relate an
anecdote <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>in point, but that it would be premature.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In that last sentence may not Grewgious refer to the plan for
sending Datchery to Cloisterham?</p>
<p>When the novel breaks off, Grewgious is working against
Jasper, but only on strong suspicion.&nbsp; If Rosa had reported
to him Jasper&rsquo;s exact words in her final interview with
him, that suspicion may have been heightened to certainty.&nbsp;
The part allotted to him in the ultimate crisis is that of
identifying the remains of Edwin, now hardly distinguishable
otherwise, owing to the action of quicklime in the Sapsea tomb,
by means of the ring which was on the young man&rsquo;s person at
the time of his murder, and which possessed invincible powers to
hold and drag.&nbsp; After giving the ring to Edwin Mr. Grewgious
had said &lsquo;Her ring.&nbsp; Will it come back to me?&nbsp; My
mind hangs about her ring very uneasily to-night.&nbsp; But this
is explainable.&nbsp; I have had it so long, and I have prized it
so much.&nbsp; I wonder&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ring will come back to him from the dust of death.</p>
<h4><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>THE
PRINCIPLES OF DISGUISE</h4>
<p>It is universally admitted that Datchery was disguised.</p>
<p>Before seeking to identify him with a character already known
to us I shall give a short note on the principles and limitations
of disguise.&nbsp; Suppose one wishes to disguise himself, how
far is it possible for him to succeed?&nbsp; What are the limits
within which success is possible?</p>
<p>The question was very carefully discussed in the <i>Berliner
Tageblatt</i> for 15th May 1912, under the title &lsquo;On the
Psychology of Dissimulation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The author, Dr. Hugo
Eick, uses the word <i>Verstellung</i> entirely in the sense of
mental disguise or purposeful deception.&nbsp; In the closing
paragraph he limits the possibilities.&nbsp; His remarks on this
question are not without value for the students of certain
literary problems.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Eick, the really fundamental things which can
never be imitated are all manifestations of positive life.&nbsp;
For example, we cannot simulate courage, enthusiasm,
humility.&nbsp; It is true that we can reproduce certain
distinctive marks of courage and enthusiasm <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>which may
deceive the inexperienced; but the essence of these qualities can
be expressed only by a person who has experienced them, and who
possesses them.&nbsp; A brave man may simulate timidity and
cowardice, the man who is capable of enthusiasm may wear the mask
of apathetic indolence; all depressive and negative conditions
may be imitated.&nbsp; But fulness of life and the sap which
quickens it cannot be replaced by any dissimulation.&nbsp; The
stupid person may persuade another stupid person to believe in
his cleverness.&nbsp; But it is impossible to counterfeit
cleverness before a clever person unless we possess a minimum of
cleverness, because a certain amount of cleverness is needed for
the deception itself.&nbsp; The real tone of truth&rsquo;s voice
can no more be copied than the fiery gleam of enthusiasm.&nbsp;
At this point all the arts of deception fail; the voice
contradicts the words.&nbsp; The man who possesses something of
these qualities of soul can indeed simulate higher degrees of the
same qualities, and can exploit them in unlimited measure.&nbsp;
But the elemental things of life are inimitable, and lie beyond
the reach of falsehood.&nbsp; He who imitates an elemental thing
is immediately discovered&mdash;supposing, of course, that <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>the
discoverer has himself some share in the element.</p>
<h4>THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS</h4>
<p>The idea that Datchery is a new character may safely be
dismissed.&nbsp; It is in one of the characters already on the
stage that we must find Datchery.&nbsp; I might proceed by taking
the characters one by one, and by a process of exhaustion arrive
at Datchery.&nbsp; But a simpler way may be to enumerate the
qualifications required in Datchery, and to show that one
character of the story possesses them all.&nbsp; The claims of
the other characters may be then discussed.</p>
<p>Datchery is assigned the task of collecting and co-ordinating
all the evidence of diverting suspicion from the innocent Neville
Landless, and fixing it on the true criminal.&nbsp; In order to
do this satisfactorily he required a combination of
qualities.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We need mental alertness and ability.&nbsp; Stupidity
would be fatal.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We need high courage and firm resolution.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We need an individual who is at once fearless and
skilful, one who knows the art of <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>disguise, one who can assume a new
character and carry through the assumption to a triumphant
end.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We need supremely a character whose whole heart goes
with the effort at detection.&nbsp; There must be behind all his
actions a passionate, personal, intimate concern.&nbsp; These
requirements, I believe, are satisfied in Helena Landless, and in
Helena Landless alone.&nbsp; The identification is naturally
received at first with a certain measure of incredulity and
surprise, but a careful and patient study of the story will
confirm it.</p>
<p>The theory was put forth by Mr. Cuming Walters in 1905 in his
book <i>Clues to Dickens&rsquo;s</i> &lsquo;<i>Mystery of Edwin
Drood</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is one of the most brilliant
conjectures or identifications in literary history.&nbsp; In
arguing for its truth I must follow largely on the lines of Mr.
Cuming Walters, but I hope to supply some fresh and fortifying
considerations.</p>
<h4>HELENA LANDLESS</h4>
<p>No one will ever understand this problem unless he studies the
method of Dickens as explained by Dickens himself in his letter
to Wilkie Collins (page 92), and in his reply to the <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span><i>Edinburgh</i>, (page 105).&nbsp; Dickens is
supremely an artist, and he tries to insert nothing without a
purpose.&nbsp; Sometimes his hints are intended to help at the
time, sometimes to mislead temporarily.&nbsp; Sometimes they are
intended to be plain when the end is reached, and the reader
peruses the story in the light of the conclusion.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Helena has the mental alertness and ability which
qualified her for the task.&nbsp; It is interesting to see from
the original manuscript and the proofs how Dickens kept raising
and lowering the lights which fell upon the Landlesses.&nbsp; We
have seen from the original manuscript in chapter vi. how Dickens
heightened his description of the pair.&nbsp; He changed &lsquo;A
handsome young fellow, and a handsome girl; both dark and rich in
colour,&rsquo; into &lsquo;An unusually handsome, lithe young
fellow, and an unusually handsome, lithe girl; much alike; both
very dark, and very rich in colour.&rsquo;&nbsp; He emphasises
Helena&rsquo;s personal characteristics: &lsquo;Slender, supple,
quick of eye and limb; half shy, half defiant; fierce of look; an
indefinable kind of pause coming and going on their whole
expression, both of face and form, which might be equally likened
to the pause before a crouch or a bound.&rsquo;&nbsp; She fought
her way through her <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>tragical childhood, was beaten by a
cruel stepfather, and would have allowed him to &lsquo;tear her
to pieces before she would have let him believe that he could
make her shed a tear.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She had a masterful
look.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rosa said to her: &lsquo;You seem to have
resolution and power enough to crush me.&nbsp; I shrink into
nothing by the side of your presence.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it is soon
manifest that Helena has a tender heart.&nbsp; She and her
brother came to the Crisparkles &lsquo;to quarrel with you, and
affront you, and break away again.&rsquo;&nbsp; But they are
touched by Mr. Crisparkle&rsquo;s kindness, and Helena is more
than touched.&nbsp; Neville tells Crisparkle that in describing
his own imperfections he is not describing his
sister&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has come out of the
disadvantages of our miserable life, as much better than I am as
that cathedral tower is higher than these chimneys.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Describing the misery of their childhood to Crisparkle, Neville
says: &lsquo;You ought to know, to her honour, that nothing in
our misery ever subdued her, though it often cowed me.&nbsp; When
we ran away from it (we ran away four times in six years, to be
soon brought back and cruelly punished), the flight was always of
her planning and leading.&nbsp; Each time she dressed as a boy,
and showed the <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>daring of a man.&nbsp; I take it we were seven years
old when we first decamped.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says again to
Crisparkle: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know, sir, what a complete
understanding can exist between my sister and me, though no
spoken word&mdash;perhaps hardly as much as a look&mdash;may have
passed between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; She has been from the beginning a born planner and
leader.&nbsp; She has shown the daring of a man.&nbsp; When her
brother lost the pocket-knife with which she was to have cut her
hair short, she tried desperately to tear it out or to bite it
off.&nbsp; Yet this strong and fiercely passionate girl had
herself under the strictest control.</p>
<p>She had no fear of Jasper.&nbsp; Rosa, Helena, Neville,
Jasper, and Edwin meet in Crisparkle&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp;
Rosa is singing under the control of Jasper.&nbsp; She bursts
into tears and shrieks out: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this!&nbsp;
I am frightened!&nbsp; Take me away!&rsquo;&nbsp; Helena
immediately comes to the rescue, and with one swift turn of her
lithe figure lays the little beauty on a sofa.&nbsp; Edwin says
to Jasper:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You are such a conscientious master, and
require so much, that I believe you make her afraid of you.&nbsp;
No wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder,&rsquo; repeated Helena.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&lsquo;There, Jack, you hear!&nbsp; You would be afraid
of him, under similar circumstances, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Miss
Landless?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Not under any circumstances,&rsquo; returned
Helena.</p>
<p>This to my mind is the first unmistakable suggestion of what
was to be developed.&nbsp; Here we have Jasper and Helena falling
into enmity almost at the first moment of their meeting,
challenging one another to battle.&nbsp; Helena accepts the
challenge.&nbsp; Not under any circumstances would she be afraid
of Jasper.&nbsp; She lives to redeem that word.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Dickens expressly tells us that Helena from her
childhood was accustomed to disguise herself as a boy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When we ran away from it (we ran away four times in six
years, to be soon brought back and cruelly punished), the flight
was always of her planning and leading.&nbsp; Each time she
dressed as a boy, and showed the daring of a man.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This is the strongest reason for the identification of Helena
with Datchery.&nbsp; I find it difficult to suppose that any
careful student of Dickens will believe that these facts about
Helena&rsquo;s disguise were put in without intent.&nbsp; It was
one of those facts which Dickens intended his readers to
interpret by the backward look.&nbsp; Those who were amazed when
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Datchery
appeared as Helena would be referred back to the significant
words which they had missed.</p>
<p>Helena protects her unhappy brother in London, and plans
against his enemies.&nbsp; She surmises that
&lsquo;Neville&rsquo;s movements are watched, and that the
purpose of his foes is to isolate him from all friends and
acquaintances, and wear out his daily life grain by
grain.&rsquo;&nbsp; She secures the help of Mr. Tartar.</p>
<p>In her conference with Grewgious, Helena plans for checkmating
Jasper, and inquires whether &lsquo;it would be best to wait
until any more maligning and pursuing of Neville on the part of
this wretch shall disclose itself, or to try to anticipate
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Helena&rsquo;s whole heart went with the effort at
detection.&nbsp; We have seen her hatred of Jasper.&nbsp; In the
conversation between Helena and Rosa about Drood and Jasper, Rosa
betrays her horror of Jasper and his mesmeric power over her,
which makes her ashamed and passionately hurt.&nbsp; They resume
on the same strain.</p>
<blockquote><p>Says Rosa:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you said to-night that you would not be afraid of
him, under any circumstances, and that <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>gives
me&mdash;who am so much afraid of him&mdash;courage to tell only
you.&nbsp; Hold me!&nbsp; Stay with me!&nbsp; I am too frightened
to be left by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lustrous gipsy-face drooped over the clinging arms and
bosom, and the wild black hair fell down protectingly over the
childish form.&nbsp; There was a slumbering gleam of fire in the
intense dark eyes, though they were then softened with compassion
and admiration.&nbsp; Let whomsoever it most concerned look well
to it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last sentence is another of the unmistakably prophetic
sentences in Dickens.&nbsp; Helena was the sworn champion
thenceforth of Rosa against Jasper.&nbsp; Helena submits herself
to the fairy bride and learns from her what she knows.&nbsp; When
Jasper is mentioned and Rosa says, &lsquo;I could not hold any
terms with him, could I?&rsquo; Helena answers with indignation,
&lsquo;You know how I love you, darling.&nbsp; But I would sooner
see you dead at his wicked feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to the close and tender affection between Helena and
Neville, and her vehement sympathy with his trial, there is no
question.&nbsp; I quote one passage because it seems to me a most
striking fact that in the proofs of Dickens the whole of it is
struck out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; said the
Minor Canon.&nbsp; &lsquo;There <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>is duty to be done here; and there
are womanly feeling, sense, and courage wanted here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant,&rsquo; explained Neville, &lsquo;that the
surroundings are so dull and unwomanly, and that Helena can have
no suitable friend or society here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have only to remember,&rsquo; said Mr. Crisparkle,
&lsquo;that you are here yourself, and that she has to draw you
into the sunlight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a little while, and then Mr. Crisparkle
began anew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we first spoke together, Neville, you told me that
your sister had risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives
as superior to you as the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral is
higher than the chimneys of Minor Canon Corner.&nbsp; Do you
remember that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was inclined to think it at the time an enthusiastic
flight.&nbsp; No matter what I think it now.&nbsp; What I would
emphasise is, that under the head of Pride your sister is a great
and opportune example to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Under <i>all</i> heads that are included in the
composition of a fine character, she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say so; but take this one. . . .&nbsp; She can dominate
it even when it is wounded through her sympathy with you. . .
.&nbsp; Every day and hour of her life since Edwin Drood&rsquo;s
disappearance she has faced malignity and folly for you as only a
brave nature well directed can.&nbsp; So it will be with her to
the end . . . [pride] which knows no shrinking, and can get no
mastery over her.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after, Neville says: &lsquo;I will do all I can to
imitate her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&lsquo;Do so, and be a truly brave man, as she is a
truly brave woman,&rsquo; answered Mr. Crisparkle stoutly.&nbsp;
In his proof Dickens struck out the words, &lsquo;as she is a
truly brave woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible, I think, to read this and not to see that
Dickens is afraid that we may too soon suspect Helena Landless of
being Datchery.</p>
<p>Neville&rsquo;s sufferings under the suspicion are
unmistakable and cruel.&nbsp; When Crisparkle saw him he wished
that his eyes were not quite so large and quite so bright.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want more sun to shine upon you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Neville
tells him that he feels marked and tainted even when he goes out
at night, and he never goes out in the day.&nbsp; He says, though
Dickens did not mean us to read the sentence: &lsquo;It seems a
little hard to be so tied to a stake, and innocent; but I
don&rsquo;t complain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such are the main reasons that induce me to believe that
Helena is Datchery.&nbsp; It is admitted on all hands that she
was meant to play an important part in the story.&nbsp; What part
does she play if she is not Datchery?</p>
<h4>DATCHERY&rsquo;S WISTFUL GAZE</h4>
<p>But the proof that impresses me as much as any other is to be
found in the passage: &lsquo;John <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Jasper&rsquo;s lamp is kindled and
his lighthouse is shining when Mr. Datchery returns alone towards
it.&nbsp; As mariners on a dangerous voyage, approaching an
iron-bound coast, may look along the beams of the warning light
to the haven lying beyond it that may never be reached, so Mr.
Datchery&rsquo;s wistful gaze is directed to this beacon and
beyond.&rsquo;&nbsp; The detective of whom this is written cannot
possibly be a mere detective.&nbsp; His heart is engaged in the
search.&nbsp; This fits Helena, and Helena only, of all the
characters that have been brought forward.&nbsp; A professional
detective paid by Grewgious could never have behaved in that
way.&nbsp; Helena&rsquo;s whole heart was in the business.&nbsp;
She had to relieve her fondly-loved brother from a cruel weight
of anxiety and suspicion.&nbsp; She had to bring a villain whose
baseness she thoroughly knew to justice.&nbsp; She had to
liberate the girl friend she loved from persecution, and she
looked to a beyond, to the haven&mdash;the haven of
Crisparkle&rsquo;s love.</p>
<h4>DATCHERY&rsquo;S WIG</h4>
<p>Datchery wears a wig, and it is unusually large, as though a
woman&rsquo;s hair were concealed under it.&nbsp; As Mr. Cuming
Walters also points <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>out, Helena undoubtedly had a strong
motive for not sacrificing her hair to the disguise, for she was
unmistakably in love with Crisparkle.</p>
<h4>DATCHERY&rsquo;S HANDS</h4>
<p>There is no doubt that if Datchery was Helena, one of her
chief difficulties must have been with her hands.</p>
<p>Miss Stirling Graeme, the author of <i>Mystifications</i>, had
a marvellous power of disguising herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was
nothing extraordinary about her,&rsquo; says Dr. John Brown,
&lsquo;but let her put on the old lady; it was as if a warlock
spell had passed over her; not merely her look, but her nature
was changed: her spirit had passed into the character she
represented; and jest, quick retort, whimsical fancy, the wildest
nonsense flowed from her lips, with a freedom and truth to nature
which appeared to be impossible in her own
personality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott in his <i>Journal</i> for 7th March 1828
tells us that when she returned to her party in the character of
an old Scottish lady she deceived every one.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
prosing account she gave of her son, the antiquary, who found an
auld wig in a slate quarry, was extremely ludicrous, and she
puzzled the Professor of <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Agriculture with a merciless account
of the succession of crops in the parks around her old
mansion-house.&nbsp; No person to whom the secret was not
entrusted had the least guess of an impostor, <i>except one
shrewd young lady present</i>, <i>who observed the hand
narrowly</i>, <i>and saw it was plumper than the age of the lady
seemed to warrant</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Daily Mail</i> of 4th April 1912 there is an account
of two girls who lived together, passing as husband and
wife.&nbsp; The man with whom they lodged said: &lsquo;The
husband&rsquo;s hands were so small and soft that both my wife
and myself were suspicious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ask the attention of readers to the manner in which Dickens
refers to Datchery&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; I do not lay too much
stress on these indications, but they deserve consideration.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We read in chapter xviii. about Datchery in the
coffee-room of the Crozier, &lsquo;as he stood with his back to
the empty fireplace waiting for his fried sole, veal cutlet, and
pint of sherry.&rsquo;&nbsp; (&lsquo;Empty&rsquo; was an
afterthought on Dickens&rsquo;s part.)&nbsp; Here we have
Datchery keeping his hands out of view.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A little after, Datchery asks the waiter to take his
hat down for a moment from the <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>peg.&nbsp; If he had stretched out
his own hand it might have been noticed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Later in the same chapter, when Datchery meets Jasper
and the Mayor, he does not shake hands with them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, making a
leg with his hat under his arm.&rsquo;&nbsp; Originally this was
written &lsquo;hat in hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he carried his hat
under his arm, one hand would be buried in the hat.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Afterwards we read of Datchery following Jasper and
the Mayor, &lsquo;with his hat under his arm, and his shock of
white hair streaming in the evening breeze.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; When Datchery is talking to the opium woman,
&lsquo;he lounges along, like the chartered bore of the city,
with his uncovered grey hair blowing about, and his purposeless
hands rattling the loose money in the pockets of his
trousers.&rsquo;&nbsp; His hands are thus out of sight.&nbsp;
Immediately after we find him &lsquo;still rattling his loose
money,&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;still rattling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; At last he begins to count out the sum demanded of
him by the opium woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Greedily watching his hands,
she continues to hold forth on the great example set
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course, she may merely be watching for the
money in his hands, but there may be <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>something more in it than
this.&nbsp; Let it be noted that Dickens originally wrote,
&lsquo;Greedily watching him,&rsquo; and inserted &lsquo;his
hands&rsquo; later.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Immediately after &lsquo;Mr. Datchery drops some
money, stoops to pick it up.&rsquo;&nbsp; In all the scene with
the opium woman he keeps his hands out of sight as much as
possible, and when he does show them they strike the old
woman.</p>
<p>I may add, though much has been said about the possibility of
detecting by means of the voice, this does not appear by any
means to be impossible, or even very difficult.&nbsp; Only one
meeting between Jasper and Helena is recorded.&nbsp; Her voice is
described as low and rich.&nbsp; Even if he had talked with
Datchery, it is more than doubtful whether he would have known
the voice again, music-master though he was.&nbsp; Datchery, if
our supposition is right, was an expert in disguise, and could
have carried it off.&nbsp; I find in the pleasant
<i>Recollections and Impressions</i> of Mrs. Sellar that she had
no difficulty in deceiving her nearest friends.&nbsp; She tells
us how one day, when Sir David and Lady Brewster were dining with
the Sellars at St. Andrews, after dinner Lady Brewster begged her
to dress up and take in Sir David:</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;But what will account for my
absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, you have been obliged to go to bed with one
of your headaches; and I&rsquo;ll introduce the
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I went upstairs, put on a false front, and was
announced as Miss Craig.&nbsp; On the gentlemen coming in I was
specially introduced to Sir David, but not being at all
attractive-looking, he soon left me for younger and fairer
friends!&nbsp; Determined he should take some notice of me, I
said I would not play the piano unless Sir David asked me; and on
this being told him he muttered: &ldquo;God bless the woman! what
does she mean!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a
name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163"
class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Lang says: &lsquo;A young lady of my acquaintance
successfully passed herself off on her betrothed as her own
cousin&mdash;also a young lady&mdash;and Dickens had not to
imagine anything so unlikely as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this I may add that Scott tells a story of Garrick and his
wife.&nbsp; Mrs. Garrick was an accomplished actress, but once
she witnessed an entertainment in which was introduced a farmer
giving his neighbours an account of the wonders seen on a visit
to London.&nbsp; The <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>character was received with such
peals of applause that Mrs. Garrick began to think it rivalled
those which had been so lately lavished on Richard the
Third.&nbsp; At last she observed her little spaniel dog was
making efforts to get towards the balcony which separated him
from the facetious farmer.&nbsp; Then she became aware of the
truth.&nbsp; &lsquo;How strange,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that a
dog should know his master, and a woman, in the same
circumstances, should not recognise her husband!&rsquo; <a
name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a></p>
<h4>THE ORIGIN OF DICKENS&rsquo;S IDEA</h4>
<p>So strong is the evidence for Helena Landless being Datchery
that even the chief advocates of the Proctor theory have fully
admitted its force.&nbsp; Dr. M. R. James says: &lsquo;I will go
as far as this: if Edwin is dead, then Datchery is Helena.&rsquo;
<a name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"
class="citation">[164b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Andrew Lang over and over
again admitted that Datchery might be Helena.&nbsp; But he
contended that, if so, the idea of Dickens is improbable with the
worst sort of improbability, is terribly far-fetched, and fails
to interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the idea of a bad sixpenny
novel.&nbsp; We are asked to credit Dickens with the highest <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>scientific
skill, and this egregious invention is the result of his
science.&nbsp; The idea would have been rejected by Mr. Guy
Boothby.&nbsp; But it does not follow that Mr. Walters has not
hit on Dickens&rsquo;s idea.&nbsp; If he has, <i>Edwin Drood</i>
is far below <i>Count Robert of Paris</i> in its first
uncorrected state, as the public will never know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is something in this argument, and it has never yet been
fairly met, but I believe that I can show that the idea was
probably suggested to Dickens by one figure in real life, and
another figure in fiction.&nbsp; So far as I am aware these
suggestions are made for the first time.</p>
<p>In the <i>Bancroft Recollections</i>, Lady Bancroft writes on
page 31:</p>
<blockquote><p>My first part at the Strand Theatre was Pippo, in
his burlesque <i>The Maid and the Magpie</i>, which proved an
immense success, and I established myself as a leading
favourite.&nbsp; It was not until the <i>Life of Charles
Dickens</i> was published that I knew his opinion of this
performance.&nbsp; Dickens had written years before, in a letter
to John Forster, these words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to the Strand Theatre, having taken a stall
beforehand, for it is always crammed.&nbsp; I really wish you
would go to see <i>The Maid and the Magpie</i> burlesque
there.&nbsp; There is the strangest thing in it that ever I have
seen on the stage&mdash;the boy Pippo, by Miss Wilton.&nbsp;
While it is astonishingly impudent (must be, or it couldn&rsquo;t
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>be done
at all), it is so stupendously like a boy, and unlike a woman,
that it is perfectly free from offence.&nbsp; I never have seen
such a thing.&nbsp; She does an imitation of the dancing of the
Christy Minstrels&mdash;wonderfully clever&mdash;which, in the
audacity of its thorough-going, is surprising.&nbsp; A thing that
you <i>cannot</i> imagine a woman&rsquo;s doing at all; and yet
the manner, the appearance, the levity, impulse, and spirits of
it are so exactly like a boy, that you cannot think of anything
like her sex in association with it.&nbsp; I never have seen such
a curious thing, and the girl&rsquo;s talent is
unchallengeable.&nbsp; I call her the cleverest girl I have ever
seen on the stage in my time, and the most singularly
original.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Bancroft adds: &lsquo;Charles Dickens&rsquo;s being
impressed with my likeness to a boy reminds me that on the first
night I acted in <i>The Middy Ashore</i>, one of the staff came
up to me at the wings and said: &ldquo;Beg pardon, young sir, you
must go back to your seat; no strangers are allowed behind the
scenes.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; From this it must be inferred that
Dickens had there that evening a new idea as to the possibilities
of disguise.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s letter was written in
1859.</p>
<p>I believe that Dickens in this Datchery assumption was mainly
influenced by Wilkie Collins.&nbsp; Most writers on Dickens have
observed his admiration for Collins, the way in which he
co-operated with him, and the high <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>value he placed on his work.&nbsp;
<i>The Moonstone</i> has been referred to in this connection, but
I venture to think that the novel which led Dickens to his idea
was <i>No Name</i>.&nbsp; I have already printed (page 91)
Dickens&rsquo;s wildly enthusiastic testimony to its
merits.&nbsp; He placed it far above <i>The Woman in White</i>,
and far above <i>The Moonstone</i>.&nbsp; In particular, he
admired the character of Magdalen Vanstone.</p>
<p>In <i>No Name</i> we are introduced to a charming
family&mdash;husband, wife, and two daughters&mdash;the
Vanstones.&nbsp; Then it turns out that the parents are
unmarried.&nbsp; The husband made a great mistake in marrying a
bad woman in his early youth, and is nearly ruined in
consequence.&nbsp; He induces a good woman to live with him as
his wife, and he has a fortune of &pound;80,000.&nbsp; By a
singular mischance both he and the mother die suddenly about the
same time.&nbsp; Vanstone had made a will leaving his property to
the daughters, but just before the death of his wife he discovers
that his real wife is dead, and so they go out and get
married.&nbsp; The law is that marriage abolishes all past
wills.&nbsp; The consequence is that the will is not effective,
and the two daughters are left without a penny, and without a
name.&nbsp; What are <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the girls to do?&nbsp; The younger,
Magdalen, has great force of character, and shows a talent for
the stage.&nbsp; She resolves to revenge herself on her
father&rsquo;s brother who has taken all the money.&nbsp; Instead
of going to work as an ordinary actress, she gives performances
of her own.&nbsp; She is very clever at acting different
parts.&nbsp; She disguises herself as an old woman, and in all
sorts of disguises.&nbsp; She is nineteen, almost the age of
Helena Landless.&nbsp; Here is a description of the way in which
she disguises herself:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found all the dresses in the box
complete&mdash;with one remarkable exception.&nbsp; That
exception was the dress of the old north-country lady; the
character which I have already mentioned as the best of all my
pupil&rsquo;s disguises, and as modelled in voice and manner on
her old governess, Miss Garth.&nbsp; The wig; the eyebrows; the
bonnet and veil; the cloak, padded inside to disfigure her back
and shoulders; the paints and cosmetics used to age her face and
alter her complexion&mdash;were all gone.&nbsp; Nothing but the
gown remained; a gaudily flowered silk, useful enough for
dramatic purposes, but too extravagant in colour and pattern to
bear inspection by daylight.&nbsp; The other parts of the dress
are sufficiently quiet to pass muster; the bonnet and veil are
only old-fashioned, and the cloak is of a sober grey
colour.&nbsp; But one plain inference can be drawn from such a
discovery as this.&nbsp; As certainly as I sit here, she is going
to open the campaign <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>against Noel Vanstone and Mrs.
Lecount, in a character which neither of those two persons can
have any possible reason for suspecting at the outset&mdash;the
character of Miss Garth.</p>
<p>What course am I to take under these circumstances?&nbsp;
Having got her secret, what am I to do with it?&nbsp; These are
awkward considerations; I am rather puzzled how to deal with
them.</p>
<p>It is something more than the mere fact of her choosing to
disguise herself to forward her own private ends that causes my
present perplexity.&nbsp; Hundreds of girls take fancies for
disguising themselves; and hundreds of instances of it are
related year after year, in the public journals.&nbsp; But my
ex-pupil is not to be confounded, for one moment, with the
average adventuress of the newspapers.&nbsp; She is capable of
going a long way beyond the limit of <i>dressing herself like a
man</i>, <i>and imitating a man&rsquo;s voice and
manner</i>.&nbsp; She has a natural gift for assuming characters,
which I have never seen equalled by a woman; and she has
performed in public until she has felt her own power, and trained
her talent for disguising herself to the highest pitch.&nbsp; A
girl who takes the sharpest people unawares by using such a
capacity as this to help her own objects in private life; and who
sharpens that capacity by a determination to fight her way to her
own purpose which has beaten down everything before it, up to
this time&mdash;is a girl who tries an experiment in deception,
new enough and dangerous enough to lead one way or the other, to
very serious results.&nbsp; This is my conviction founded on a
large experience in the art of imposing on my
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I say <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of my fair relative&rsquo;s
enterprise what I never said or thought of it till I introduced
myself to the inside of her box.&nbsp; The chances for and
against her winning the fight for her lost fortune are now so
evenly balanced that I cannot for the life of me see on which
side the scale inclines.&nbsp; All I can discern is, that it
will, to a dead certainty, turn one way or the other on the day
when she passes Noel Vanstone&rsquo;s doors in disguise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not prepared to criticise Dickens&rsquo;s plot as Mr.
Lang has done.&nbsp; If Wilkie Collins made an admirable heroine
of Magdalen Vanstone disguising herself variously, why should not
Dickens succeed in making a character as wonderful and more
attractive of Helena Landless?&nbsp; There is nothing to be
condemned in the idea itself.&nbsp; It has been used by masters,
and used successfully.&nbsp; There would have been nothing to
condemn, I believe, in Dickens&rsquo;s way of working it out if
he had lived to complete his book.&nbsp; The comparison with Guy
Boothby is singularly inept.</p>
<h4>OBJECTIONS</h4>
<p>The objections that have been made to the Datchery-Helena
theory turn mainly on the supposed disgracefulness of Dickens
deceiving his readers as he did, and working out a <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>melodramatic idea.&nbsp; These objections might have
been, and, I believe, would have been, scattered to the winds by
the complete story.</p>
<p>The most serious objection to the identification of Datchery
as Helena is the confusion in the chronology.&nbsp; This is
admirably stated by Dr. Jackson, who examines in a masterly way
the arrangement of the chapters.&nbsp; He comes to the conclusion
that chapter xviii. has been introduced prematurely.&nbsp; It
ought to have followed chapter xxii. If Dickens had lived to
issue the fifth and sixth monthly instalments, he would have
placed our chapter xviii. without the alteration of a single word
after chapter xxii., next before chapter xxiii.&nbsp; We know
that Dickens told his sister-in-law that he was afraid the
Datchery assumption in the fifth number was premature.&nbsp; Dr.
Jackson gives us a full and valuable examination of the
manuscript so far as its arrangement is concerned.&nbsp; I have
tested his statements in every point, and can only confirm
them.&nbsp; To Dr. Jackson&rsquo;s chapter ix., &lsquo;The
Manuscript,&rsquo; I refer the reader.</p>
<p>There are other objections.&nbsp; In particular, some are
troubled by Datchery&rsquo;s masculine ways.&nbsp; They ask how
Helena, fresh from Ceylon, should <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>have known the old tavern way of
keeping scores.&nbsp; There is not much in this.&nbsp; In fact,
these scores, which could have served no purpose, seem to me the
natural expression of a buoyant girl rejoicing in her
achievements.&nbsp; A cool-headed, middle-aged detective would
never have expressed himself in such a way.&nbsp; Why should not
Helena have known about tavern scoring?&nbsp; She was accustomed
to walk with her brother Neville, and in the course of their
walks they may very likely have visited a tavern now and
then.&nbsp; We read of Neville finding his way to a tavern when
he walked away that dark night.&nbsp; In <i>Phineas Finn</i>, at
the end of chapter lxxi., Trollope, reporting the conversation of
two high-born ladies, Lady Laura Kennedy and Miss Violet
Effingham, has this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Was I not to forgive him&mdash;I who had
turned myself away from him with a fixed purpose the moment that
I found that he had made a mark upon my heart?&nbsp; I could not
wipe off that mark, and yet I married.&nbsp; Was he not to try to
wipe off his mark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems that he wiped it off very quickly; and since
that he has wiped off another mark.&nbsp; One doesn&rsquo;t know
how many marks he has wiped off.&nbsp; They are like the
innkeeper&rsquo;s score which he makes <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>in
chalk.&nbsp; A damp cloth brings them all away, and leaves
nothing behind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows, at least, that chalk-marking is not a matter of
esoteric knowledge in England, but is known to high and
low.&nbsp; I may note that Dickens inserted the adjective
&lsquo;uncouth&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;a few uncouth, chalked
strokes&rsquo;&mdash;over his original manuscript, to make it
clear no doubt that the scorer was an amateur at the
business.</p>
<p>Then there are objections to Datchery&rsquo;s masculine
fare&mdash;fried sole, veal cutlet, and pint of sherry; bread and
cheese, and salad and ale.&nbsp; It must be remembered that
Helena was in disguise.&nbsp; This was not a mere disguise of
dress, but it was a disguise of everything.&nbsp; She was
assuming a character and carrying it out.&nbsp; She had all the
ability and all the will for accomplishing this.&nbsp; In doing
masculine things she was simply carrying out her disguise.&nbsp;
A woman passing for a man must do what a man would do or she will
fail, and be found out.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that if Datchery is Helena, and
therefore knows the Gatehouse, why does she give it &lsquo;a
second look of some interest&rsquo;?&nbsp; Dr. Jackson replies
very well that the house for her has now a new importance, and is
the object upon which her thoughts are to <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>be
concentrated for weeks, and perhaps for months.&nbsp; But Dickens
did not mean this passage to be printed, for good reasons of his
own.</p>
<h4>WHAT DICKENS DID NOT MEAN US TO READ</h4>
<p>This leads us to note that certain passages which have been
much discussed were not meant for publication by Dickens.&nbsp;
That is, he struck them out in proof.&nbsp; Dr. Jackson points
out that in chapter xviii., when Datchery consults the waiter at
the Crozier about &lsquo;a fair lodging for a single
buffer,&rsquo; he is obviously asking to be recommended to
Tope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The waiter is puzzled at first.&nbsp; When
Mr. Datchery asks for &lsquo;something venerable, architectural,
and inconvenient,&rsquo; the waiter shakes his head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anything cathedraly, now?&rsquo; Mr. Datchery
suggested.&nbsp; Then comes the mention of Tope.&nbsp; Datchery
boggles about the cathedral tower seeking for lodgings, but
Dickens did not mean us to read the words: &lsquo;With a general
impression on his mind that Mrs. Tope&rsquo;s was somewhere very
near it, and that, like the children in the game of hot boiled
beans and very good butter, he was warm in his search when he saw
the tower, and cold when he didn&rsquo;t see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>When
the Deputy pointed out Jasper&rsquo;s, first Dickens wrote
&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, with an
appearance of interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he wrote:&nbsp;
&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Datchery, with a second
look of some interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he struck out the
sentence entirely.</p>
<p>Dickens also struck out the sentence which describes Datchery
after the Deputy left him: &lsquo;Mr. Datchery, taking off his
hat to give that shock of white hair of his another shake, seemed
quite resigned, and betook himself whither he had been
directed.&rsquo;&nbsp; He also struck out the passage in which
Mrs. Tope and Datchery talk of what occurred last winter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps Mr. Datchery had heard something of what
had occurred there last winter?</p>
<p>Mr. Datchery had as confused a knowledge of the event in
question, on trying to recall it, as he well could have.&nbsp; He
begged Mrs. Tope&rsquo;s pardon when she found it incumbent on
her to correct him in every detail of his summary of the facts,
but pleaded that he was merely a single buffer getting through
life upon his means as idly as he could, and that so many people
were so constantly making away with so many other people as to
render it difficult for a buffer of an easy temper to preserve
the circumstances of the several cases unmixed in his mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly all the conversation between the Mayor and Datchery is
deleted.&nbsp; See page 9.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Also
Dickens erases the little talk between the Deputy and Datchery
beginning: &lsquo;Master Deputy, what do you owe me?&rsquo;&nbsp;
See page 11.</p>
<p>It may not be possible to deduce any assured inference from
these omissions, but they are worth pondering, and may be
referred to again.</p>
<h3><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>CHAPTER VII&mdash;OTHER THEORIES</h3>
<h4>THE DROOD-DATCHERY THEORY</h4>
<p>One opposing theory is that Datchery was Drood.&nbsp; With all
respect for the scholars who have propounded it, this appears to
me a purely comic notion.&nbsp; It is the most fantastical of all
fancies as to who was Datchery.&nbsp; As Dr. Blake Odgers points
out, every one at Cloisterham knew the murdered man: a mere white
wig would be no disguise at all.&nbsp; I may add that if Jasper
had discovered him he would almost be justified in finishing the
murder this time.&nbsp; For what would be Drood&rsquo;s
object?&nbsp; The theory is that, in spite of his being drugged,
throttled, perhaps thrown from a tower, at all events buried in
quicklime, and in all probability locked up in the tomb, Drood
got away when his uncle was triumphantly flinging his watch and
scarf-pin into the river.&nbsp; Supposing it were so, what was
Drood doing <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>while he watched his uncle?&nbsp; Is it said that he
was so bemused by the opium that he did not know who had handled
him in such a murderous fashion?&nbsp; This is very hard to
believe.&nbsp; Mr. Andrew Lang himself says: &lsquo;Fancy can
suggest no reason why Edwin Drood, if he escaped from his wicked
uncle, should go spying about instead of coming openly
forward.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Archer says the flaw is that the theory
provides no motive whatever for Drood&rsquo;s disguising himself
as Datchery.&nbsp; Why should Drood devote himself to an
elaborate scheme of revenge upon his near kinsman and
friend?&nbsp; He would want to hush the matter up, and save
Jasper from himself.&nbsp; Why did Drood let Neville lie under
the suspicion of murder, and why was not Rosa let into the
secret?&nbsp; It is hardly worth while to point out that there is
nothing in Drood&rsquo;s character as given us which could have
enabled him to show the ability, the composure, and the
self-control of Datchery.&nbsp; Who could have supplied him with
money to live idly at Cloisterham?&nbsp; His money was all locked
up till he came of age, and Jasper was his guardian and
trustee.&nbsp; If Grewgious supplied the money, why did not
Grewgious make an end of Neville&rsquo;s misery?</p>
<h4><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>THE
BAZZARD-DATCHERY THEORY</h4>
<p>A far more plausible theory is that Datchery was
Bazzard.&nbsp; Dickens almost invites readers to connect Bazzard
with Datchery when he makes Grewgious say to Rosa when she came
up to London that Bazzard &lsquo;was off duty here altogether
just at present, and a firm downstairs with whom I have business
relations lend me a substitute.&rsquo;&nbsp; (The words
&lsquo;here altogether&rsquo; were added by Dickens.)</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Dickens in some way meant to explain
Bazzard&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; But that Bazzard should have been
Datchery will appear a sheer impossibility to careful students of
Dickens.&nbsp; Proctor, whose side remarks are often excellent,
puts the point briefly as follows: &lsquo;No one at all familiar
with Dickens&rsquo;s method would for a moment imagine that
Datchery is Bazzard, Mr. Grewgious&rsquo;s clerk.&nbsp; Bazzard
was as certainly intended to come to grief, and be exposed in the
sequel as was Silas Wegg in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters says: &lsquo;Literary art rebels against
the idea.&nbsp; Bazzard was one of Dickens&rsquo;s favourite low
comedy characters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. James dismisses the Bazzard theory <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&lsquo;because Buzzard in his first and principal
appearance has too much both of the fool and of the knave about
him to develop into the Datchery whom we are intended to
admire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson says: &lsquo;Capacity can ape incapacity, but
incapacity cannot ape capacity.&nbsp; This being so, I am sure
that Bazzard, who is not only &ldquo;particularly angular, but
also somnolent, dull, incompetent, egotistical, is wholly
incapable of playing the part of the supple, quick-witted,
resolute, dignified Datchery.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; In these
judgments I agree.&nbsp; Bazzard has no ethical quality.&nbsp; He
has not the smallest personal interest in the discovery.&nbsp;
How could it be said of Bazzard that his &lsquo;wistful gaze is
directed to this beacon, and beyond?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the theory is obvious and popular, it may be worth while to
say something more, and Dr. Hugo Eick&rsquo;s words, as
previously quoted, may help us.&nbsp; Helena Landless had the
elemental qualities needed for the Datchery role.&nbsp; Note that
among Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroines who masquerade as men,
Rosalind, in <i>As you Like It</i>, and Julia, in <i>Two
Gentlemen of Verona</i>, have not these elemental qualities and
are suspected.&nbsp; Portia has them, and even her own husband
does not know her in her doctor&rsquo;s robes.&nbsp; She <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>is
recognised by all as a young doctor, but not one person in court
thinks &lsquo;There is a woman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Bazzard might have
imitated depressive and negative conditions, but he could not
have imitated the qualities of positive life.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fulness of life and the sap which quickens it cannot be
replaced by any dissimulation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should also be noted that if Bazzard was Datchery, he had
no occasion to disguise himself in a huge white wig, for he was
not known in Cloisterham.</p>
<h4>THE GREWGIOUS-DATCHERY THEORY</h4>
<p>The theory that Datchery was Grewgious may be dismissed in a
sentence.&nbsp; Grewgious with his &lsquo;awkward and hesitating
manner,&rsquo; his &lsquo;shambling walk,&rsquo; his
&lsquo;scanty flat crop of hair,&rsquo; his &lsquo;smooth
head,&rsquo; his &lsquo;short sight,&rsquo; his general
angularity fits in no way the watchful, courtly, adroit, fluent,
and versatile Datchery.</p>
<h4>THE DATCHERY-NEVILLE THEORY</h4>
<p>Mr. Lang has a wild conjecture somewhere that Neville was
Datchery, and that Helena was disguised as Neville.&nbsp; It is
difficult to treat this seriously.&nbsp; Neville would inevitably
have been found out.&nbsp; His cause was undertaken by <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>his
friends, and his business was to study and wait.&nbsp; Why on
earth should Helena disguise herself as Neville?</p>
<h4>THE TARTAR-DATCHERY THEORY</h4>
<p>There is something more attractive about this theory, and it
has been very well argued by Mr. G. F. Gadd in the
<i>Dickensian</i>, vol. ii. p. 13.&nbsp; Mr. Gadd uses the
argument &lsquo;with a second look of some interest,&rsquo; as
showing Datchery&rsquo;s ignorance of Cloisterham.&nbsp; He
quotes Tartar&rsquo;s phrase &lsquo;being an idle man,&rsquo; as
corresponding with the &lsquo;idle buffer living on his
means.&rsquo;&nbsp; He suggests that Dickens at this point of his
story avails himself of the licence not unfrequent in fiction of
temporarily abandoning the strictly chronological order.&nbsp; He
suggests that Tartar as a seafaring man might know something of
opium smoking, and compares the wistful gaze directed to this
beacon and beyond, to what is said about Tartar as he and Rosa
entered his chambers at Staple Inn.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rosa thought . .
. that his far-seeing eyes looked as if they had been used to
watch danger afar off, and to watch it without flinching, drawing
nearer and nearer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, as Dr. Jackson points out, Tartar has <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>his duties
assigned to him.&nbsp; He has to watch over Neville and see him
almost daily.&nbsp; Again, Tartar does not know about Cloisterham
and the Drood mystery what Datchery knows and needs to
know.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thirdly, I doubt whether the cheery,
straightforward, simple-minded Tartar is capable of
Datchery&rsquo;s versatility, subtlety, and address.&rsquo;&nbsp;
To this I add that Tartar&rsquo;s heart is not engaged in the
business as Helena&rsquo;s is.&nbsp; Also what need is there for
his disguise?&nbsp; He has never been in Cloisterham, and nobody
there knows him.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For these reasons we conclude that Helena and no other is
Datchery.&nbsp; I have taken no account of the theory that
Datchery is an unknown person.&nbsp; An unknown person could not
possess the necessary qualities of heart.</p>

184</span>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;HOW WAS &lsquo;EDWIN DROOD&rsquo; TO
END?</h3>
<p>How <i>Edwin Drood</i> was to end is a problem which can only
be solved to a certain extent.&nbsp; We find we are left in the
middle, and as much mystery remains as fully justifies the
title.&nbsp; We do not know the precise manner in which the
murder was accomplished.&nbsp; In particular, we are left
ignorant as to the way in which the crime is to be brought home
to the victim.&nbsp; We cannot define the relations of the opium
woman to Drood and Jasper and the Landlesses.&nbsp; We do not
know the history of Jasper&rsquo;s early years.&nbsp; We can do
no more than speculate, and the speculations must be confined
within strict limits.&nbsp; The first question is, whether
Dickens himself knew how he was going to extricate and complete
his narrative.</p>
<p>Scott has left us the astonishing statement <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> that &lsquo;I have generally written
to the middle of one of these novels without having the least <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>idea how it
was to end.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Skene, a true friend of Sir Walter
Scott, tells us <a name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a> that when Scott described to him the
scheme which he had formed for <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>, he
suggested to him that he might with advantage connect the history
of Ren&eacute;, king of Provence, in which subject Skene had
special means of helping him.&nbsp; Scott accepted the
suggestion, &lsquo;and the whole <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the
story of <i>Anne of Geierstein</i> was changed, and the Provence
part woven into it, in the form in which it ultimately came
forth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was Dickens in the same case when death interrupted him in his
work?</p>
<p>Was this an &lsquo;apoplectic&rsquo; novel?</p>
<p>Scott speaks frankly of <i>Count Robert of Paris</i> and
<i>Castle Dangerous</i> being his &lsquo;apoplectic
books.&rsquo;&nbsp; Does <i>Edwin Drood</i> bear the same
relation to the body of Dickens&rsquo;s work as <i>Count Robert
of Paris</i> and <i>Castle Dangerous</i> bear to the Waverley
Novels?&nbsp; Mr. Lang, whose views on this subject varied much,
in one of his later writings takes the view that Dickens was
deeply embarrassed.&nbsp; He says: &lsquo;It is melancholy to
think of this great and terribly overtasked genius tormented by
fears that were only too real.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>He finds
the story wandering on, living from hand to mouth, full of
absurdities.&nbsp; He thinks that Dickens was very capable of
changing his original purpose, and saving the life of Edwin.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Dickens was puzzled about the order of
his chapters.&nbsp; Forster tells us that Dickens &lsquo;became a
little nervous about the course of the tale from a fear that he
might have plunged too soon into the incidents leading on to the
catastrophe such as the Datchery assumption (a misgiving he had
certainly expressed to his sister-in-law).&rsquo;&nbsp; I have
already expressed agreement with Dr. Jackson in his plan for
renumbering the chapters.&nbsp; Unless this plan is adopted there
is chronological confusion.&nbsp; Also there is no doubt that
Dickens had been working under terrific strain.&nbsp; But the
testimony of those who knew him best is that his faculties were
never brighter and stronger than they were in his last
months.</p>
<p>The same impression is left upon me by his unfinished
novel.&nbsp; Those who dislike Dickens&rsquo;s later manner may
easily find faults.&nbsp; They may say that Honeythunder is
grotesque rather than amusing.&nbsp; They may say that
Jasper&rsquo;s courtship of Rosa is melodramatic and
wolfish.&nbsp; I confess to being perpetually puzzled by the <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>account of
Neville&rsquo;s capture on the morning after the murder.&nbsp;
Why was he pursued in that manner?&nbsp; All that was known
against him was that he had been with Edwin on the previous
night.&nbsp; He is only eight miles away from Cloisterham, and
stopping at a roadside tavern to refresh.&nbsp; He starts again
on his journey, and becomes aware of other pedestrians behind him
coming up at a faster pace than his.&nbsp; He stands aside to let
them pass, but only four pass.&nbsp; Other four slackened speed,
and loitered as if intending to follow him when he should go
on.&nbsp; The remainder of the party (half a dozen, perhaps) turn
and go back at a great rate.&nbsp; Among those who go back is Mr.
Crisparkle.&nbsp; Nobody speaks, but they all look at him.&nbsp;
Four walk in advance and four in the rear.&nbsp; Thus he is
beset, and stops as a last test, and they all stop.&nbsp; He
asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Why do you attend upon me in this way? . .
.&nbsp; Are you a pack of thieves?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t answer him,&rsquo; said one of the number.
. . .&nbsp; &lsquo;Better be quiet. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not submit to be penned in,&rsquo; says Neville;
&lsquo;I mean to pass those four in front.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They all stand still, and he shoulders his heavy stick and
quickens his pace.&nbsp; The largest <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>and strongest man of the number
dexterously closes with him and goes down with him, but not
before the heavy stick has descended smartly.&nbsp; Naturally
Neville is utterly bewildered.&nbsp; Two of them hold his arms
and lead him back into a group whose central figures are Jasper
and Crisparkle.&nbsp; Why on earth did not Crisparkle speak to
him at the beginning, and tell him what had happened?&nbsp; All
this is somnambulistic.</p>
<p>There seems to be a slight slip in chapter ii.</p>
<p>Jasper&rsquo;s room at the Gatehouse is described.&nbsp; It
has an unfinished picture of a blooming schoolgirl hanging over
the chimneypiece.&nbsp; At the upper end of the room Mr. Jasper
opens a door and discloses a small inner room pleasantly lighted
and prepared for supper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fixed as the look the young fellow meets is, there is
yet in it some strange power of suddenly including the sketch
over the chimneypiece.&rsquo;&nbsp; They dine in the inner
room.&nbsp; The cloth is drawn, and a dish of walnuts and a
decanter of rich coloured sherry are placed upon the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s she looking, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s concentrated face again includes the
portrait as he returns: &lsquo;Very like your sketch
indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&lsquo;I am a little proud of it,&rsquo; says the young
fellow, glancing up at the sketch with complacency, and then
shutting one eye, and taking a corrected prospect of it over a
level bridge of nut-crackers in the air.</p>
<p>Dickens seems to have forgotten that the sketch is in the
other room.</p>
<p>It seems to me that these are slips, but I do not find any
other readers have taken the same view.&nbsp; With these
exceptions, the story seems to be one of Dickens&rsquo;s best
books.&nbsp; Its grasp of local colour and detail is as strong as
ever it was.&nbsp; There is much of his old humour in the Mayor,
in Miss Twinkleton&rsquo;s Girls&rsquo; School, in Billickin, in
Durdles and his attendant imp.&nbsp; Also the story is
constructed with the greatest care and ingenuity.&nbsp; Any one
who carefully goes over the manuscript and the proofs will see
that Dickens had a plan in his mind that he half revealed and
half concealed, that his phrases and details are chosen with the
nicest care, and that he meant to reward those who at the end
could take a &lsquo;backward look&rsquo; by the delight they
would experience in seeing how everything had been scrupulously
planned and artistically conducted to a climax.&nbsp; We cannot
do justice to the book in its present state.&nbsp; But <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Dickens&rsquo;s royal genius was at its full, and would
have vindicated itself.&nbsp; He had set himself deliberately to
carrying out a plot far more exact than he had ever attempted,
and the end was in view from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the reason of every incident and every
description was disclosed from the first.&nbsp; I have previously
discussed Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s reading of <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, and shown that his perception, keen as it was, yielded
him less than he thought.&nbsp; I have shown how Dickens prepared
the plan for <i>Little Dorrit</i> from the start of his
book.&nbsp; It may be traced now, but without the &lsquo;backward
glance&rsquo; it would not have been easy to trace it.</p>
<p>We may also say with some confidence that no new characters of
importance would have been introduced to us in the second
half.&nbsp; In the chapter &lsquo;Half Way with Dickens&rsquo; I
have shown that this is the case with five of his principal
books.&nbsp; The conclusion is not stringent, for Dickens was
free to change his method.&nbsp; But it may be said to be highly
probable; if it is true we are left to conjecture the part that
the various characters would have played in the winding up of the
tale.</p>
<p>The book was to end with the capture and <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>conviction
of Jasper.&nbsp; I have already written of the part played and to
be played by Grewgious.&nbsp; Another hunter of Jasper was
Durdles.&nbsp; The task assigned to Durdles among the hunters is
fairly clear.&nbsp; Sooner or later, by tapping round the Sapsea
monument he is to discover the presence of &lsquo;a wheen
banes,&rsquo; or at least of some unsuspected
&lsquo;rubbish.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had put the inscription on the
monument before Christmas, and had no doubt satisfied himself
then that all was safe.&nbsp; &lsquo;When Durdles puts a touch or
a finish upon his work, no matter where, inside or outside,
Durdles likes to look at his work all round, and see that his
work is a-doing him credit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having made his inspection when the epitaph was put on,
Durdles would have no further curiosity about the tomb until, in
the following summer, he took Mr. Datchery on a rambling
expedition as he had taken Jasper.&nbsp; His peculiar gift, like
that of the bloodhound, is to aid in tracking down the
quarry.</p>
<p>Deputy has also his part to play.&nbsp; From the first Jasper
hates and fears Deputy, and there are signs near the close of
<i>Edwin Drood</i> that this strange boy, who has some
characteristics in common with Dickie Sludge, of
<i>Kenilworth</i>, is to form a close alliance with
Datchery.&nbsp; The <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>ugliest side of Jasper&rsquo;s
character displays itself in his treatment of the &lsquo;young
imp employed by Durdles.&rsquo;&nbsp; The chanting of the line,
&lsquo;Widdy Widdy Wake-cock warning,&rsquo; has for him a note
of menace.&nbsp; With the fury of a devil he leaps upon the boy
when he emerges from the crypt with Durdles, and hears a sharp
whistle rending the silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will shed the blood
of that impish wretch!&rsquo; he cries; &lsquo;I know I shall do
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Durdles has to appeal to him not to hurt the
boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;He followed us to-night, when we first came
here,&rsquo; says Jasper.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has been prowling near
us ever since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Deputy denies both accusations.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d only
just come out for my &rsquo;elth when I see you two a-coming out
of the Kinfreederal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What has Deputy actually seen?&nbsp; He may have testimony to
give of the most vital consequence, but even if he has seen
nothing of Jasper&rsquo;s movements while Durdles lies asleep, or
of his approach to the Sapsea monument, he will tell Mr. Datchery
of that furious onslaught when Jasper clutched his throat and
threatened to kill him.&nbsp; He will prove a very useful ally of
the hunters.</p>
<p>It seems quite inconceivable that either Durdles or Deputy
could have known the whole <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>secret and kept it.&nbsp; Neither of
them was capable of keeping a secret long.&nbsp; But they might
have suspicions, and they might and would know circumstances
which when rightly interpreted led to the inevitable
conclusion.</p>
<p>I cannot but think that the chief part in the coming narrative
was to be played by the opium woman.&nbsp; The novel from the
very first page has a touch of the East.&nbsp; In Wilkie
Collins&rsquo;s <i>The Moonstone</i> the Indians did their part,
and then vanished from the scene.&nbsp; But in <i>Edwin Drood</i>
we have the Landlesses from Ceylon with a touch of dark blood, or
at least of the Eastern spirit.&nbsp; Mr. Lang is in excess of
the facts when he calls them Eurasians, and Dickens hesitates in
ascribing black blood to them.&nbsp; They are more probably
gypsies.&nbsp; We have also the connection of Edwin Drood with
the East.&nbsp; There is more than a suggestion of dark blood in
John Jasper.&nbsp; Above all, we have the opium woman.&nbsp; What
was the connection between John Jasper and the opium woman?&nbsp;
What was John Jasper&rsquo;s history before he came to
Cloisterham?</p>
<p>We do not know, but conjectures have been hazarded.&nbsp; Mr.
Cuming Walters thinks that the opium woman&rsquo;s hatred of
Jasper may be due <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>to the fact that Jasper has wronged a child of the
woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He also conjectures that Jasper may be the
son of the opium woman.&nbsp; Dr. Jackson conjectures that Jasper
seduces a young girl who had treated the old woman kindly, that
he neglected this girl for Rosa, that the girl committed suicide,
and that the old woman devoted herself to the pursuit of the
betrayer.&nbsp; All this is mere speculation.&nbsp; We have
really no means of judging whether the speculation is true or
not.&nbsp; It does seem that the woman&rsquo;s peculiar hatred of
Jasper must have an origin and a grave cause.&nbsp; Miss Stoddart
suggests that the opium woman was not wholly degraded, and that
she is horrified by Jasper&rsquo;s continually repeated
threatenings while under the influence of opium; that her
sympathies have been wakened for that hapless Ned who bears a
threatened name, and she resolves to do her best to serve
him.&nbsp; With an honest purpose she makes her way before
Christmas to Cloisterham.&nbsp; She loses sight of Jasper, but
actually meets Edwin Drood.&nbsp; The kind act of that young
stranger causes her to unload her conscience, and she bids him be
thankful that his name is not Ned.&nbsp; At her second visit in
the summer she knows from Jasper&rsquo;s <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>confessions
under her own roof that the long premeditated crime has actually
taken place, and her object in visiting Cloisterham is to gather
evidence that may serve the ends of justice.&nbsp; This sunken
creature has a task assigned to her, and she fulfils it.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Dickens means to throw any redeeming light
on the character of the opium woman.&nbsp; She has been wronged;
she is seeking vengeance, and at last, she finds it.&nbsp; How
this comes to pass Dickens meant to tell us, but he meant, no
doubt, to surprise us in the telling.</p>
<p>My own belief is that Dickens intended to surprise his readers
by telling them of some unsuspected blood relationship between
his characters.&nbsp; Surprises of this kind are given in his
novels.&nbsp; No reader of <i>Oliver Twist</i> could have guessed
from the first part Oliver&rsquo;s relationship to Monks and the
Maylies.&nbsp; Who would have supposed from the first half of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> that Smike was the son of Ralph?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;That, boy,&rsquo; repeated Ralph, looking
vacantly at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom I saw stretched dead and cold upon his bed, and
who is now in his grave&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is now in his grave,&rsquo; echoed Ralph, like one
who talks in his sleep.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>The
man raised his eyes, and clasped his hands solemnly together:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;Was your only son, so help me God in
heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of a dead silence Ralph sat down, pressing his
two hands upon his temples.&nbsp; He removed them after a minute,
and never was there seen, part of a living man undisfigured by
any wound, such a ghastly face as he then disclosed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, who would have supposed from the early part of <i>Great
Expectations</i> that Estella was the daughter of Abel Magwitch?
<a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a></p>
<p>In <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, Maypole Hugh turns out to be an
illegitimate son of Sir John Chester.&nbsp; In <i>The Old
Curiosity Shop</i>, &lsquo;The Stranger&rsquo; is found to be the
brother of the Grandfather.&nbsp; In <i>Bleak House</i>, Esther
Summerson is revealed as a daughter of Lady Dedlock.&nbsp; In
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, John Rokesmith turns out to be John
Harmon.</p>
<p>That the action of opium had a part to play in the revelation
can hardly be doubted.&nbsp; The whole book is drenched in
opium.&nbsp; In <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span><i>The Moonstone</i> the problem is who stole the
jewels.&nbsp; It is solved by opium.&nbsp; The jewels are stolen
by a man under the influence of opium surreptitiously
administered.&nbsp; He is quite unconscious of what he has done,
and remains unconscious.&nbsp; Afterwards he is discovered by a
fresh administration of opium.&nbsp; When the opium has
completely done its work the man repeats his deed, and the
experiment is conclusive.</p>
<p>I do not think that any one reading right on would name the
perpetrator of the theft, and yet when we take a backward glance
we find an account of a dinner-party about the seventieth page
which gives the clue.&nbsp; I doubt whether any one on first
reading it would see in it anything that mattered, and yet it
contains everything that matters.&nbsp; The height of art in work
like this is to conceal art.&nbsp; You may be able at an early
stage to introduce facts which contain the ultimate solution of
your problem, and yet appear important enough to be stated for
their own sake.&nbsp; The solution of the problem, or rather the
materials of the solution, should be given, and yet the reader
should be unable to detect the full significance of the
preliminary statement till the complete clearing arrives.&nbsp;
At the same time the <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>book will not be satisfactory if
details are superfluous, if they do nothing to carry one on to
the dissipation of the mystery.</p>
<p>It is not to be denied that this fitting of everything into
its place is at times a little wearisome.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
construction is most minute and most wonderful,&rsquo; wrote
Anthony Trollope of Wilkie Collins.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can never lose
the taste of the construction.&nbsp; The author seems always
warning me to remember that something happened at exactly
half-past two on Tuesday morning, or that a woman disappeared
from the road just fifteen yards beyond the fourth
milestone.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is truth in this, but if Anthony
Trollope had written a novel of mystery, which perhaps he could
never have done, he would have had to take the same path.</p>
<p>Another doctor in <i>The Moonstone</i> tells us that the
ignorant distrust of opium in England spreads through all
classes, so much so, that every doctor in large practice finds
himself every now and then obliged to deceive his patients by
giving them opium under a disguise.&nbsp; He himself claims that
opium saved his life.&nbsp; He suffered from an incurable
internal complaint, but he was determined to live in order to
provide for a person very dear to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;To <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>that
all-potent and all-merciful drug I am indebted for a respite of
many years from my sentence of death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Like Collins, Dickens was keenly interested in the
possibilities of opium.&nbsp; Collins himself was a lavish
consumer of the drug, but I do not think it has been suggested
that Dickens himself ever touched it.&nbsp; Nor is it likely, for
Dickens with all his tenseness of nerve was an eminently
self-controlled and temperate man.&nbsp; But in <i>Edwin
Drood</i> he has inserted a sentence in praise of opium.&nbsp;
The opium woman says to Datchery: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s opium,
deary.&nbsp; Neither more nor less.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s like a
human creetur so far, that you always hear what can be said
against it, but seldom what can be said in its
praise.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last sentence was an afterthought on the
part of Dickens.&nbsp; It has been written in.</p>
<p>As to whether Jasper was made ultimately to repeat his crime
in any fashion under the influence of opium, it is impossible to
say.&nbsp; He was unquestionably more or less under the influence
of the drug when he committed it.</p>
<p>The literary men of Dickens&rsquo;s period were much
interested in the action of drugs, in mesmerism, and the
like.&nbsp; Elliotson, to whom <i>Pendennis</i> is dedicated, was
on intimate terms <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>with Dickens.&nbsp; Dickens plainly implies that
Crisparkle went to the weir because Jasper willed him to do
so.&nbsp; Collins and Dickens were both addicted to calling
witnesses to their accuracy.&nbsp; At the close of
<i>Armadale</i>, Collins says: &lsquo;Wherever the story touches
on questions connected with law, medicine, or chemistry, it has
been submitted before publication to the experience of
professional men.&nbsp; The kindness of a friend supplied me with
a plan of the doctor&rsquo;s apparatus&mdash;I saw the chemical
ingredients at work before I ventured on describing the action of
them in the closing scenes of this book.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every one
remembers the &lsquo;spontaneous combustion&rsquo; preface to
Bleak House.&nbsp; I do not know whether any medical man can be
found to confirm the science of <i>Armadale</i>, or of <i>Bleak
House</i>, or of <i>The Moonstone</i>.&nbsp; But that is not the
question before us.&nbsp; We have only to do with what the
novelist himself believed to be a scientific possibility.&nbsp;
In <i>Kenilworth</i> <a name="citation200"></a><a
href="#footnote200" class="citation">[200]</a> Wayland compounds
&lsquo;the true Orvietan, that noble medicine which is so seldom
found genuine and effective within these realms of
Europe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Scott adds a note: &lsquo;Orvietan, or
Venice treacle, as it is sometimes called, was understood to be
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>a
sovereign remedy against poison; and the reader must be
contented, for the time he peruses these pages, to hold the same
opinion, which was once universally received by the learned as
well as the vulgar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s science must be
received in the same manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Crisparkle has one piece of evidence in his memory.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Long afterwards he had cause to remember&rsquo; how, when
he entered Jasper&rsquo;s rooms and found him asleep by the fire,
the choirmaster &lsquo;sprang from the couch in a delirious state
between sleeping and waking, and crying out, &ldquo;What is the
matter?&nbsp; Who did it?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>As we have already seen, the gathering of the threads is in
the strong hands of Datchery.</p>
<p>As we know, Forster adds that Neville Landless was to have
perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the
murderer.&nbsp; It will be seen that this part of his testimony
is more doubtful than the rest, and cannot, therefore, be so
implicitly accepted, but it may well be true.&nbsp; Melancholy
seems to mark Neville Landless for its own, and his passion for
Rosa is hopeless.&nbsp; If he dies, it is a heavy blow for his
devoted sister, who finds her triumph marred by the death of her
brother.&nbsp; Singularly enough, <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>some writers who have hesitated to
accept Forster&rsquo;s more expressed testimony make much of the
death of Neville Landless and its circumstances.&nbsp; It need
only be pointed out that all this is pure conjecture, however
ingenious it may be.</p>
<p>I find no difficulty in believing that Dickens carried out his
plan of making Jasper give in prison a review of his own
career.&nbsp; This has been called a poor and conventional idea,
but as worked out by Dickens it would neither have been poor nor
conventional.&nbsp; What remains to be told is, I repeat, largely
the story of John Jasper&rsquo;s earlier life.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
